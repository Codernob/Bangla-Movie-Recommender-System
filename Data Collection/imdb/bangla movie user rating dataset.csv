0,adnannizhum,One Time Watch,7,1 November 2021,"It is an average film. One time watch. But Fazlur Rahman Babu is top notch as usual. Others actors performance is average. Editing was fine. Cinematography is also satisfactory.

1,SoumikBanerjee25,These kinds of subjects demand a rather serious treatment!,3,20 November 2021,"Another sub-par attempt from the Bengali Industry to do some thoughtful and stirring demonstrations of real-life barbarism. What could have easily been an apt social commentary on such delicate topics, ended up being another one of those expository means; whose sole existence is simply for attending to the core narrative and nothing else.An erratic and rather laid-back execution that never intended to solidify the societal issues nor all the systematic corruptions that lies deep underneath. Instead, it had gone for outrageous leisure and machoism. Even in that particular aspect, it fails to attain the desired mark. All due to its inferior writing and the whole ensemble consisting of nothing but a bunch of monotonous personalities!There was no apparent dearth of talented individuals though, and to be honest, some of them did give their honest efforts and it shows.But then again, what more could an actor do other than what he/she has been instructed to!I blame the lack of vision more than anything else over here.",F.I.R NO. 339/07/06,tt15698592
2,MandalBros-5,A GOOD Bengali Film. ðŸ‘Œ,8,30 October 2021,"The story of this film is very simple, a police officer is investigating some murder mysteries. But, this film tried very well to give it a real touch that made the film different from other Bengali films in last few years. The mystery was revealing slowly that made the screenplay engaging. At least you'll not get bored for a moment.Surprisingly loved everyone's performances specially of Ankush. If I say about negative points then I'll say there were some moments which were not that necessary. And you can guess the killer from the 1st half. But, still you'll love the film and I think the film succeeded what it wanted to achieve. Finally, it's really good to see such type of film in Bengali, hope we'll get to see more like this in near future.Available on ZEE5.Â© MandalBros.",F.I.R NO. 339/07/06,tt15698592
3,shovonbhattachrjee,Good Movie,6,26 October 2021,"The storyline of this movie is good and the acting is also good. This movie has a story, that has some suspense but it is not like a thriller movie. The story of this movie is based on a revenge story but the story is not very much clear. On behalf of acting, this is a good movie but if you tell me about the storyline of this movie, I have some doubts.

4,anandolodh-96284,Good watch,7,23 October 2021,"Actually this plot is really strong but director couldn't able to keep100% suspense. While watching this one I was predicted something clue by clue. At the end I find myself successful. I think this deserved some better quality making. Clues are very frank to audience and that's very bad. When we enjoy malayam film, directors always give clues but we cnt predict much about twist but thi time he failed.But good watch. You can watch it without boredom. Actually it is one time watchable film. Enjoy...

5,dip-48764,Nostalgia,1,15 October 2021,"Regardless of the fact it took me back to my own childhood, every song hit a different chord. The direction was amazing and abstract. It wasn't trying to be anything but was simply trying to explore who Arnob is and what his songs mean to us. Thank you for making this.

6,rupam_aditya,Pretty Underwhelming,6,26 September 2021,"Visually pleasing, the songs sound good. That being said, the documentary/musical film didn't feel like a deep dive into the artist's personality as it pretends to be. The narration is very incoherent, doesn't really land anywhere. Didn't quite match my expectation.
