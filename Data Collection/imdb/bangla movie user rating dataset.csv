1,SoumikBanerjee25,These kinds of subjects demand a rather serious treatment!,3,20 November 2021,"Another sub-par attempt from the Bengali Industry to do some thoughtful and stirring demonstrations of real-life barbarism. What could have easily been an apt social commentary on such delicate topics, ended up being another one of those expository means; whose sole existence is simply for attending to the core narrative and nothing else.An erratic and rather laid-back execution that never intended to solidify the societal issues nor all the systematic corruptions that lies deep underneath. Instead, it had gone for outrageous leisure and machoism. Even in that particular aspect, it fails to attain the desired mark. All due to its inferior writing and the whole ensemble consisting of nothing but a bunch of monotonous personalities!There was no apparent dearth of talented individuals though, and to be honest, some of them did give their honest efforts and it shows.But then again, what more could an actor do other than what he/she has been instructed to!I blame the lack of vision more than anything else over here.",F.I.R NO. 339/07/06,tt15698592
2,MandalBros-5,A GOOD Bengali Film. üëå,8,30 October 2021,"The story of this film is very simple, a police officer is investigating some murder mysteries. But, this film tried very well to give it a real touch that made the film different from other Bengali films in last few years. The mystery was revealing slowly that made the screenplay engaging. At least you'll not get bored for a moment.Surprisingly loved everyone's performances specially of Ankush. If I say about negative points then I'll say there were some moments which were not that necessary. And you can guess the killer from the 1st half. But, still you'll love the film and I think the film succeeded what it wanted to achieve. Finally, it's really good to see such type of film in Bengali, hope we'll get to see more like this in near future.Available on ZEE5.¬© MandalBros.",F.I.R NO. 339/07/06,tt15698592
3,shovonbhattachrjee,Good Movie,6,26 October 2021,"The storyline of this movie is good and the acting is also good. This movie has a story, that has some suspense but it is not like a thriller movie. The story of this movie is based on a revenge story but the story is not very much clear. On behalf of acting, this is a good movie but if you tell me about the storyline of this movie, I have some doubts.

4,anandolodh-96284,Good watch,7,23 October 2021,"Actually this plot is really strong but director couldn't able to keep100% suspense. While watching this one I was predicted something clue by clue. At the end I find myself successful. I think this deserved some better quality making. Clues are very frank to audience and that's very bad. When we enjoy malayam film, directors always give clues but we cnt predict much about twist but thi time he failed.But good watch. You can watch it without boredom. Actually it is one time watchable film. Enjoy...

5,dip-48764,Nostalgia,1,15 October 2021,"Regardless of the fact it took me back to my own childhood, every song hit a different chord. The direction was amazing and abstract. It wasn't trying to be anything but was simply trying to explore who Arnob is and what his songs mean to us. Thank you for making this.

6,rupam_aditya,Pretty Underwhelming,6,26 September 2021,"Visually pleasing, the songs sound good. That being said, the documentary/musical film didn't feel like a deep dive into the artist's personality as it pretends to be. The narration is very incoherent, doesn't really land anywhere. Didn't quite match my expectation.

7,MandalBros-5,An ENJOYABLE Watch With FAMILY.,8,17 October 2021,"First of all, I'll recommend this movie to watch with your family. It had a childish flavour, so children will definitely enjoy it but also will not understand many things. You may find some negative points if you watch it alone. But as it was promoted as a children's film, these can be ignored.Acting wise everyone did their job nicely, I liked Kharaj Mukherjee as Gobu Chandra the most. The dialogues were rhythmic just like we've seen in 'Hirak Rajar Deshe'. Songs were not memorable except 'Bombagorer Golpo', but those were depicting the situation of the story, which was looking good. Finally, it's very rare to see this kind of film, so I think you should definitely watch this but only with your family.¬© MandalBros.

9,senanindya,Disappointed.,3,2 October 2021,"One of worst direction of all time.Chanchal chowdhury shouldn't have agreed to do this project. It's really no way near to his level. After watching unoloukik, my expectations were very high. Watching this really broke my heart.Dialogues, Editing, cinematography, acting (obviously except for chanchal & purnima), production everything really felt very amateur.

Although I expected thrilling like ""Aynabaji Movie"" but it was not in this web flim. Since this is a detective story, everyone who watches will have to pay close attention to understand the story. Also, if there was a little more twist towards the end of the story and if the screntime of the web flim is a little more, the web flim would look better. Finally I would like to say, thanks ""Chorki"" again for giving us good contents continuously. But I want the watch rest of the next part of ""Munshigiri"" web film.

Very fresh faces also they know acting. I never get bored or I didn't pretend the story until the ending. Which hold me to sit until the ending.

An amazing story with a beautiful screenplay and a great combination of cinematography and music.But one thing I should tell the whole industry. Please try to promote our own culture. I can see the cultural diversion last couple of years by the renowned directors and actors. This is not our culture, this should not be the message to the young generation. Please be aware of that.Anyway, great work by the director, actors, and the whole team. It's a good Bangladeshi film that I can feel. Especially technical team deserve credit for visualizing a dazzling show for one and half an hour.",Networker Baire,tt15234108

37,ali-mahdi,Lots of potential but wasted nonetheless,6,9 October 2021,Very disjointed storytelling and lots of unnecessary melodrama. Photography and cinematography was commendable but it lacks where every Bangla telefilm/film produced these days lack- substantial plot and/or build-up.Simple things make no sense like how are they calling people to talk about their sap stories if indeed they are out of network coverage?What was the ultimate point of getting out of coverage? Was it the journey that they meant to highlight or the destination? Or did they just bank on a shock ending?I bet with a little bit of effort they could have set the characters up nicely so that the end really matters instead of pulling away to reveal side stories that hardly mean anything.Decent effort. Not really worth the time though.,Networker Baire,tt15234108

44,huloh,Average,5,27 August 2021,"Overhyped movie, actually it's not more like a telefilm or an extended drama. Last part was touchy, friends were cool enough to entertain, but at some point It's illogical. A vegetable seller's son enjoying party is a bit unnatural, the so called true friends conversation like "" khaia dis na"" is a bit weired. I have never seen true friends, 1 girl and 4 boys drinking bear and doing nonsense in bengali community. Even if It's true,it can't be tagged as a true one.Camera work and acting was pretty good. Flow was natural no doubt. Just the sexual objectification was creepy. Overall,it a good time pass with average storyline but can't win oscar or get 8+ rating unfortunately.

Mizanur Rahman Aryan has arranged the relation of friendship in a wonderful way. I enjoyed the chemistry of four friends a lot. Their chemistry has also become more enjoyable due to their extraordinary performance. Besides, those who have played the role of lovers have also done well, especially Nazifa Tushi. I have laughed throughout the whole movie but cried towards the end. In the end I will say this, after a long time I saw a clean, extraordinary work and Mizanur Rahman Aryan is successful in his first movie.

71,tasrifulhaquesalim,"A cheap, third class and Balmarka movie",1,25 August 2021,"Even with a cheap, third-class and Balmarca movie, it's possible to get this level of hype, I wouldn't have understood if I hadn't seen the movie off the network, believe me !!Excluding everything, I did not see any protest against the cheap form of girls that has been highlighted here !! None of you, I repeat, did anyone notice this?After flirting for two minutes, a girl goes inside the bus, her girlfriend says at the party, ""Don't eat me"", and after giving a little consolation, one friend's girlfriend falls asleep with another friend, I mean, how come? Girls are so cheap? Do you think so? There are so many female characters in this story, what message did you want to give to everyone here? When you get a boy, you fall asleep? No self-esteem?Said at the beginning, will tell the story of friendship. And at the end, another friend fed his friend's girlfriend. Going to the end of the movie, the hero was made again. I'm not really sure, what message did the director actually want to give through this? Or did you want to give a message at all?Inspired by the true story of Ahsan Ullah University's six boys who have been joking, I think, families should take refuge in the law by gathering evidence.This is not a friendship story. This is the story of filth. Sex is not a bad thing in art or literature. Masood Rana also has extreme sex. Butt there is no immorality, no deception. Sex comes as much as needed.And what has been done outside of the network is that sex has not been inserted in the need of the story, but sex has been inserted by force. The director has cheated in the name of telling friendship stories. And throughout the story, he portrays women in a terribly cheap way.Of course those who haven't seen it yet, don't need to see this garbage.If you want to see a St. Martin tour and a movie about friendship, visit Cinnamon Island. I don't see the need to be in such a bad mood to have such an awesome movie.And, if you want to see the story of friendship, a few people from DMC made a telefilm, ""The story is about friendship"". You can also see it. So wonderful, so beautifully told the story of friendship there!Bengalis like to make hype, it was known. Again the last hype that was taken with the series, Mahanagar, it was really a beautiful series, it was like taking a hype.The level of hype you raised about a garbage named out of the butt network was unbelievable.",Networker Baire,tt15234108

And the sound quality was amazingly good too.The music of this film, particularly the song ""Rupkothar jogote"" blew the spirit and touched my heart.But one thing, at the end of the movie, the reason why Ratul and Abir were fighting was dramatic. I would expect that to be realistic.Perfect combo in a set. Everyone must watch. Highly recommended.

95,ariyadsust,Excellent Job!! Mind blowing casting!! Entertaining stuff!!,9,7 August 2021,"One of the finest entertaining movie coming out of totally disoriented and resource constricted industry. I wouldn't believe what they had achieved until i finally decided to sweep my superficial pride of being an ardent international movie enthusiast under the rug. Got my subscription for chorki after asked incessantly about another project which was running on the same platform, so ""you tumor"" came as a bonus for me.So i grabbed my laptop and indulged myself to be disappointed again with poor screenplay, acting and development of the stories. But one thing for sure, my expectations were neutral as it was late night, I thought I wouldn't be able to reach finish line. To be very honest, haven't been following any works of the main actors nothing at all, except i heard pritom singing one time. So, i had no preconceptions and didn't know what to expect. Although i am aware of contemporary work of other directors of Bangladesh.Enough with the pretext, i will go right into the movie.I was hooked from the start, acting struck me first. Then, an ordinary/ typical gen z story coated in the society that i grew up managed to hold my attention. May be because, randomised placement of the characters from any young mans life in Bangladesh made it appealing and sturdy. Fun aspect was, getting aid/ providing aid (complimentary) from/ to infamous Youtube/ Facebook celebrity who were prevalent in the digital ecosystem of the country.Music arrangements were cool, so was Jackson vai. Atleast, he gave some pure laughs and enticed me to crack some late night ciggies.I think, director envisioned ""only entertainment"" as a outcome and he delivered that eloquently. Atleast some cares about entertainment rather than being obsessed with participating in awards function only.I would say, this movie deserves proper attention. But sharing my utmost gratification to the team and the protagonists.Thanks.Peace out!",YouTumor,tt15090336
96,StifuBD,Lame Content,1,29 July 2021,"It was such a mistake watching this one. I got in even without watching the trailer, I already figured out what genre this movie would belong to but it is really a waste of time. Its not even funny. Very cringy & unreal story. Worst content and disgrace for our industry.If you're still in quarantine or you have too much time to waste, I highly recommend you to watch this one, especially if you're cringe lover.

The thing is, Polash and Pritom were good enough to their own roles but the storyline and Screenplay wasn't good. That's why, I think this Webfilm can't get good feedbacks, because the Director (Adnan Al Rajeev, who made one of my favourite film @18: All Time Dourer Upor) couldn't fulfill our expectations by these two megastars of today! And also some big mistakes took part in this film and some lame Dark Comedy Punchlines!

First talk about the positive things: it have good comedy with good background music,It have two finest actors of BD in leading role: Pritom Hassan & Polash Also it had some good side actors such as: jijo bhai,jackson bro. & the main point it shows the recent time youtube phobia to become famous & it's bad effects
Then the negative things is: i don't think it has a good Plot like it's amazing or didn't see anywhere else & sometimes ended up with bad humours like it looks like some years ago youtube comedy videos. But i wish best luck to the whole CHORKi team.

104,SoumikBanerjee25,Inefficient,4,18 September 2021,"Being the official retelling of Anjaam Pathiraa; the possibilities were enormous. Even though I haven't seen the original by myself; I only heard good things about it. So finally when the announcement of this Bengali remake came into the open; I was thrilled. Little did I know, I was to regret my over-excitement.Inefficient; yes, that's the most accurate term I can use to recapitulate my exact feelings. From the Screenplay to its character set-ups; everything felt unskillful and somewhat rudimentary in a sense. Thus making it a highly disappointing session from a viewer's standpoint.Talking of setbacks, why stick to the same PG-13 stuff? It's high time the creators embrace the full-blown glory of Blood and Gore. And looking at this story, in particular; it demanded those anyways. That being said, the technical sides aren't half bad. In contrast, I completely admire the Cinematography and the scalability of the Score.Speaking of Performances; it's decent. No means exceptional, but collectively they do a pretty good job. It's again the Writing that makes the situation much more difficult. A script that needed nothing but competent characterization, was deprived of the same. Therefore, not producing the much-desired output!",Mukhosh,tt14992954
105,msunando,When policemen are targets of a serial killer ........,7,17 October 2021,"When an experienced police officer of the Kolkata Police is found murdered, the department seeks the investigative skills of criminologist Kinshuk Roy (Anirban Bhattacharya), as the murderer has left behind a cryptic clue. Kinshuk's investigations take him to many places, but not before another policeman ends up gruesomely murdered. This time, Kolkata Police needs to protect its reputation and act in a haste, because Kinshuk has already started sniffing the motive behind the murders, and smells that a much decorated officer, with whom he is working closely, may be in the line of fire. Simultaneously, he needs to confront someone whom he has almost revered.""Mukhosh"" is a fast paced crime thriller playing out in the underbelly of Kolkata and is a battle of wits. Just under two hours, it makes for an interesting, albeit not a nail biting watch. As the motive unfolds, you know who the murderer is, and that's a little underwhelming, as the director Birsa Dasgupta could have easily held the suspense until the very end. As such, the thrill element in Mukhosh is somewhat mellow, but that is compensated by the acting of the principal characters. Anirban Bhattacharya is spot on as a criminologist, and Anirban Chakraborty is good too. But it is Tota Roy Chowdhury who stands out in a special appearance as a steely, determined and agile individual with an objective.",Mukhosh,tt14992954

Mukhosh is an Bengali psychological thriller directed by Birsa Dasgupta & starring Anirban Bhattacharya, Anirban Chakraborti, Chandreyee Ghosh & Koushik Sen.Mukhosh is a remake of the 2020 Kunchacko Boban starrer Malayalam film Anjaam Pathira.Anirban Bhattacharya is a resident criminologist for the police. The lawmakers are baffled when a series of murders are committed where the victims are police officers themselves. With no clues left behind by the killer, except for a blood cross with verses from the Bible etched on the back, the police struggle against time to prevent any more murders from happening. Will they succeed or will the Mukhosh have the final say!!Even though I had watched Anjam Pathira last year,I enjoyed watching it's remake. No stone left unturned to make this film on par with the original. Casting direction, cinematography dialogues are all bang on target to make this an enjoyable watch for all whodunnit fans. It will be a Durga Pujo treat since most of my Bong friends might not have watched the Malyalam original.Adios üôÇ",Mukhosh,tt14992954

Unfortunately, Mukhosh is a cliched vengeance tale that we've seen many times before and barely proffers us anything NEW. If you've watched enough crime-thrillers, you would guess the 'climax' from a mile before.I didn't like the character of criminologist Kingshuk, played by Anirban Bhattacharya, at all. In the very first scene, he prophesies that this murderer has NO PERSONAL REASONS, but that's the complete opposite of what happened, and I sensed that was a dense scene. Even the way Anirban acted in the film was underwhelming at best; his wife seemed more interested or inherent to solve the cast.Similarly, Tota Roy Chowdhury's depiction simply didn't fit the character IMO. The backstory should've had more substantial consequences to make it a strong plot. I didn't conjecture the point of casting Sohini for just a moment.",Mukhosh,tt14992954

Man nods ominously.I mean seriously! Why can't they write better stuff? There are more examples of hammy dialogues delivered in hammy ways all throughout the movie.A sheer waste of the two Anirbans - both excellent actors.

The culprit is caught easily, Dialogue delivery is also very weak and its weak background music makes the film more vulnerable. The film is a murder mystery which is why I am giving it 6 ratings.

130,sanjidparvez,An Amazingly Strong Female lead that we rarely see in a movie,9,3 December 2021,"I think Rehana is one of the best written strong female leads that I have seen in movies in recent years. The most intriguing part is she isn't perfect; she's flawed & arrogant at times and that made her so much grounded & believable at the core.Rehana's determination, anger & at the same time helplessness in her everyday struggle was set against our broken values & views towards women and director Abdullah Mohammad Saad depicted that flawlessly through a confined premise of a workplace and bluish, nightmarish color tone till the very symbolic, last sequence of the movie. This settings quite skillfully captures Rehana's suffocating surrounding and fights for the justice; yet at the same time slowly unfolds another excellent sub-plot of her little daughter who is also going through a terrible time at the school.On its premier, the film received a standing ovation at the 2021 Cannes Film Festival; and I must say, at least for the performance of Azmeri Haque Badhon on the lead, supported by Afia Jahin Jaima, that amazing child actress played the role of Rehana's daughter...both truly deserved that. With Rehana, now I can finally see a new dawn for Bangladeshi cinema...which was more or less in a limbo for quite a long time. As a Bangladeshi viewer, this just made me proud that a hard hitting film like this have made in Bangladesh!",Rehana,tt14775748

136,reesu_daddy,Seriously!! What's the Point?,1,12 November 2021,"I am utterly disappointed in the movie. The Media made it seemed like a very good movie, went to Cannes Film Festival, awarded with Asia Pacific awards, etc, etc. I started watching, being aware that this is a Drama genre movie, and had expectation that it would be a good drama. After watching for 1 hour 47 minutes, I was totally lost. I mean, what's the point of the movie? Where is the story? Where did the story lead to? Tried to give a social message of sexual harassment at workplace, but the portrayal was very ordinary. The color grading, cinematography, color tone, camera works, screenplay, direction, everything was a total waste. Most 10/10 reviews in here are fake, surely posted by known people of the production team and cast.Doob by Sarwer Faruki was a waste, this is a greater waste by multiple times.

138,sudip_rulz,"You made us proud, Team Rehana",1,17 August 2021,"This is Bangladeshi director Abdullah Mohammad Saad's second feature film. And it is the first Bangladeshi film that made into official 'Cannes Film Festival'. No wonder, why people were so excited about this film. The story envelopes when an assistant professor at a private medical college, Rehana, witnessed a sexual assault. She went into a deep struggle to handle the situation as she knew the both victim and the offender. From the beginning we came to know how stubbornly self-willed personality Rehana has. The movie displays the great strength of Rehana's discovering the truth against the typical male oriented society's mastery. Even in the third act, she had to confront her daughter's school authority because the other student used to pinch her baby daughter in the first place.The movie was solely driven by the amazing acting performance of. Azmeri Haque Badhon. She used to be a very promising model and actress of Bangladesh. Very recently she has worked in an web series called. Robindronath Ekhane Kawkhono Khete Aashenni (2021). She acted brilliantly in there also. But to be honest, in Rehana Maryam Noor, Badhon was simply top notch. She adopted and adapted the character superbly.I must admire the sound design and the supreme close-up shots style of camera work. It added extra emotions to a scene to perfection. The color grading helped to express the intensity of the storyline.Overall, I really liked the movie. I sincerely hope Rehana will inspire so many people in so many levels. Thank you Team Rehana for making the Bangladeshi people proud.",Rehana,tt14775748

152,sami_shahid_al_islam,Mesmerizing Performance and outstanding storytelling,9,16 August 2021,"""Rehana Maryam Noor"" once again shows that cinema is not just about portraying the script, rather telling a story using the cinema language. The story itself is not very uncommon, rather something many people can relate in our part of the world. But, the storytelling here is outstanding, without saying much the movie gives me goosebumps in few scenes. Acting by the lead actress Badhon was mesmerizing, such a performance that I'd remember for a long time and also the very reason I'd watch this movie multiple times. I felt the boiling rage in her acting which was the distinctive feature of the protagonist of the film. Hats off to the director for his craftmanship in beautifully making this story alive! I feel happy that this is only his second film and I wish to see many more gems like this from his talented mind!

158,FrogmanSujan,Artistically Assembled Anthology,7,29 July 2021,"Bangladeshi indie films ought to be reaching more to its people. There need to be much more promotional ventures of films like these sorts.Halt is an anthology film containing three different stories with the same theme: deception or outwitting. The film was a great watch the whole time, especially I found the cinematography and background score pretty attaching. Truth be told, it actually even felt sort of 'exotic' to me. I really can't say that living in the same country but the place, the atmosphere, the characters, their language; everything appeared to be so 'unknown' and 'other' to me. And what made this whole feeling of unfamiliarity more realistic got to do with the camera-work and the setting of the film. Halt is a film that tells a very familiar story but with its own aloof style of narrative.P. S.: Other than that, what was the significance of turning that frog into some sort of low budget cgi thing? Was that a subtle part of some kind of semiotics or was it just that? I need an insight into this.",Halt,tt14631866

Slightly slow in pace but I guess for self introspection of the central character this slowness was required.Two stories run parallel and inspite of the fact that the woman has no dialogue, her estrangement with son could be understood clearly equating her lonliness with the main character.Theme of lonliness has been portrayed beautifully along with vacant roads, foggy sky, and pine jungles.I love Kurseong, and haven't been out since last yr, hence nature visuals engulfed me.I don't know how old is Akash...but probably in his early 20s.

Otherwise ,this is a complete disappointment. Though I would like to appreciate the hard work of the entire team for their brave attempt. If you love Bengali movie ,give it a try. You won't be disappointed if you expect less.

Camerawork could have been bettered but nonetheless the producer had the guts to come out with such a project when it could have run the risk of being compared to Gully Boy and for no fault of its own. Performances of actors like Parambrata (who anyway has become a veteran by now) and especially Samiul deserve special mention. The biggest dampener according to me was Madhumita, who badly needs to work on her mannerisms as well dialogue delivery especially if she aims to rule the roost in future.

It is an interesting attempt to experiment with this genre in bengali language. This film is no big-banner one with glitz and glam of the industry but it says a true story with a true spirit. The child actors have given mind blowing performances. Parambrata is definitely an added charm. Madhumita is good. These kind of movies should be encouraged more in the coming days.

This is a well researched film. The movie is not only about the life of Hiralal Sen but also you'll get to know about many unknown yet important personalities.This movie has lots of humour that worked very well. Acting is one of the strongest points of this film. Kinjal Nanda, in his debut, has done a great job in the role of Hiralal Sen ; he has much more to do in future. Anuska Chakraborty as Hemangini and Arna Mukherjee as Amar Dutta portrayed their characters brilliantly. At the end, Hiralal will definitely make you emotional.As this film depicts the life of first filmmaker of our country, I think it's a MUST WATCH for every Cinephile.Available on Hoichoi.¬© MandalBros.",Hiralal,tt14176430

It is the story of a first filmmaker of India. Not only that the film explores the conflict among producer,director and distributor. The true artists only live in their art, they don't understand any more than that. This is a wonderful movie. What a performances not only from the lead but also from the entire supporting casts.

On the other hand, a self made businessman is eager to know the meaning of an English word his banker considers him.Spoiler ahead!!!!!!Two parallel story. One is, Mosharraf Karim, a businessman, looking for a word meaning buying a dictionary. The English word his banker told him. His son argue with the banker for correct meaning. However, Mosharraf Karim is the best, even in foreign, he proved it.The other one is, Abir Chatterjee, where he is a good-for-nothing husband of Nusrat Jahan. His wife is making love with another man, but knowing everything he has no feeling, no reaction, no backwash, not a single word. He is infirm all in all. His wife making sex with her lover and then when her lover got married, she comeback to her husband and then she makes sex with her husband. Her husband has no reaction, no huff, just doing sex and forget everything, forgetting this, that his wife once (may be several times) slept with another man, and he has nothing to say. One of the least self-respect and stupid man in the world. By the way, the unnatural lips of Nusrat Jahan worsen the movie experience.The authority gives a message to the society that, even your wife does anything in your absence, even your wife sleeps with anyone, don't take step to get back her, just wait for her comeback and forget everything. Thus, promoting Adultery, Extramarital affair, Extramarital sex. How ridiculous!",Dictionary,tt14063668
194,srutimisra,Not even a one time watch,1,23 May 2021,"""Dictionary"" is a Bengali language drama film which was released in 2021, directed by Bratya Basu. The movie is based on two short stories ""Baba howa"" and ""Swami howa"" written by Buddhadeb Guha. Mosharraf Karim, Abir and Nusrat are the protagonists. Mosharraf plays the role of a businessman who can't communicate in English. Abir is an introvert forest officer and Nusrat plays the role of his wife. She has an extra marital affair with Mosharraf's brother in law.The trailer was very promising so I decided to give it a watch. First of all, Thanks to Nusrat. She took the half responsibility for spoiling the movie. The onscreen adaption is very bad. Script writing and dialogue delivery both are pathetic. Abir's performance is typical as usual. The only good thing is the performance of Mosharraf Karim. He's the reason, I spent my valuable time for. The climax is also very disappointing. Seems like it has a forceful ending.According to me, ""Dictionary"" is not even a one time watch movie. Watch it at your own risk.",Dictionary,tt14063668
195,Dips3105,Nothing will get apart from Abir,5,29 October 2021,"Subject wise the movie was quite good. But with her school of acting Nusrat should be casted opposite Abir, she won't deserve a chance. Abir is class actor, he may not have muscle, he may not that dance skill, he may not have that skill to be a super-human in Bengali movie what we used to see till a few years ago, but in his generation, considerably, he is one of the most talented actor of bong industry, it will not be wrong if I say, he is one of best actor ever bengali industry have produced. So, Nusrat opposite him looks like a furniture. But, yeah the story is good which I liked the most in this movie.

His part of story was too good ....If that part was bigger ,I would rate this film at least 8 !! But I think it had potential ,but not worked on that with the most hardwork !!

204,nowrozefarhan,Celluloid meets reality- true depiction of violence,8,21 January 2021,"'Janowar aka The Beast' is a harrowing portrayal of rape and murder, based on a true story happened last year in Bangladesh. We see and read these headlines almost regularly, but do we ever understand how much torture the victims endure? This movie made me feel like I was in the crime-scene witnessing nerve-wrecking abuse. The unbearable torture at times made me feel cry for the victims , may their soul Rest in Peace.
Raihan Rafi, director, successfully visualizes the brutality. Taking the concept of a happy family house suddenly turned into life-and-death parade, he beautifully contrasted the two opposite tones with artistic measure. All the cast members gave the best performance they could. Seeing the performance of the villain, you will be convinced to think of them as the real criminal. Such raw animosity!
I was particularly impressed with the screenplay, the way script was built-taking a simple story of violence and treating with non-linear pattern and flashbacks, creating elements of crime-thriller through sound and camera movement was astonishing. All those slo-mo montages where the departed souls cry out adds more to the raw nature of emotions.
Aside from rape and murder, this movie points out one of the most sensitive issue in the coming-of -age era, the violence towards women, how the very lack of security and how we failed as a society to give protection to our women. On that note, this film acts as a powerful social commentary.
""Janowar"" is not a perfect movie by any means, there are some unnecessary repetition and gore scenes that could have been trimmed, some silly graphics in the end too. But still, this film is a milestone in BD industry It can't get any more real, a true sketch of violence.",Janowar,tt13845664
205,sefafatjuln,Not good not bad just a basic line,7,23 September 2021,"The story comes from a original events. The actual chemistry among the story line and characters are perfectly matched . The director shows boldness, by previewing devil and cruelty in good sense of screen.The strong point in this film is the characters and acting. Everyone did a good part at their role. The weak point is the camera work. Definitely you can watch and enjoy it.

206,ShuvoIMDb,I can't get it out of my head,8,16 January 2021,"Raihan Rafi is one of the most promising talented directors of our time. Earlier, he introduced himself with two movies. Going beyond the conventional trend in the history of Bengali cinema, he gave surprises in the previous two movies. However, 'Janowar' has overwhelmed everything.I could guess a bit after watching the trailer, but after watching the movie I can't get it out of my head now. There was violence but the tension did more than that. Each character is brought to life. You will be forced to hate some characters.Although I expect more rather than the torture scene all the time, I felt pretty disturbing while watching the movie. Thought police have a pretty vital role in this movie. I expected that how police have investigated and arrested the criminal will be shown, but it is not.Everyone has done well in acting. Such a movie has been made as a result of everyone's equal contribution. But Apu and the little girl of the movie was remarkable. mind blowing performance by both of them. The cinematography is extraordinary and brilliant.In the end, I will say this, 'Janowar' is a milestone in the history of Bengali movies. It is very important for a Bengali film to have such a movie. I hope the good days of the Bengali film will come with the help of Raihan Rafi and others.",Janowar,tt13845664
207,IbtihajFahad,Raw,9,18 January 2021,"The casting is perfect along with tight editing, strong direction & meticulously done cinematography. Very few Bangladeshi film have this much depth. No doubt, 'Zanowar' sets a new bar for the Bangla Thiriller genre.

216,istiaqe-89618,A marathon of goosebump and shock,8,23 January 2021,"Mind you, this rigid movie can shiver your nerves by traumatizing your whole sanity and fill you up with extreme pessimism. You would end up thinking how can life be so much brutal and hateful!Massive shout out to the director to bring this up to the mass and show us the reality with pure rawness. I mean dramatization was there, it had to be. But still to be very honest, I felt like the direction and writing were the only sections where this movie somehow lacked.The story was moving enough for me to feel uncomfortable, the music mostly felt too much dramatic and unnecessary. Dialogues in some scenes could have been better and some scenes could have been shortened and shot better in my opinion.And must say, that acting of main antagonist was so good that at some point I almost felt like all those stuffs were actually happening in front of me. Whole cast did amazing job with the performance, 10 out of 10 on that.Overall, it's a great achievement in our filmmaking industry. A very thrilling experience indeed.Final verdict : 8 out of 10",Janowar,tt13845664

Moonmoon Ahmed Moon how good you were,how strong was the emotion,loved it.Really proud of you.Have to mention the little girl Ariya Arittra who was so excellent with her role,such innocence,such nice and also was so pathetic to see in the worse moment. And Rashed Mamunur Rahman the villain,my goodness how cruel and beast he looked,totally a masterpiece.Taskin was superb.
Last but not the least Raihan Rafi the Mastermind such terrible work he has done.The way to tell story,the camera work,editing and everything you cant say that there were any mistakes or anythingDont watch it if you are weak,a good work like these should be appreciated.",Janowar,tt13845664

227,abirakram2011,"Not even close to perfection but, hype",1,20 January 2021,"The story of the film is based on true event. And that is the only strength of this film. People who belong to the same country, the story of this movie took place are providing higher rating and driving by the emotion. Though i am from the same country, to me its not a good movie from any of the aspects i can find out to judge a movie. Its only strength, the true event also violated by the movie casting. Reason 1. A woman and her two daughter were murdered and raped brutally and after that in the morning police came, when no one was alive to tell the event, yet police hypothetically and out of his imagination see everything which we saw as movie. This weaken the story of movie. As it is based on true event it can not be shown like that way. If convicts would tell this then it would be considerable.
Reason 2. All the victims were female yet there was no female police which is not acceptable in this movie. And another major thing is police tempered the crime seen before the arrival of forensic team. Which surely violets the true event title of the movie.
Reason 3. This one is major. This types of violent film required real weapon. There were no real weapon in the movie. Which makes the film less imaginable and less live.
Reason 4. First 15 min of the film was ok. But when main focus started ""the violent"" All the acting and performance were poor. I would have given them 10 on 10 if it was stage drama. But it is a movie which is the mirror of real life as it is based on true event. Acting was not even close to perfection.
Reason 5. Casting was so so. But Dialogue and camera performance was not satisfied quality except the opening seen. Dialogue was so poor and delivered even poorer manner.This movie is incomplete and way to away for 9/10 on 10. I can not give more than 5/10.",Janowar,tt13845664
228,sihabsikdar,A perfect visionary of the reality,1,15 June 2021,"This is the first movie i'm reviewing on IMDB, i think it deserves an out of box appreciation. It is made with that much visionary what the victims face but we can't able to imagine how tragic it is. We can't imagine how and what was happened with them by reading an article and news. But hats of to Raihan Rafi for this effort on Portraying a visual to this tragedy. The actors don't make u feel that they are acting.

It brings in people with different ideologies in one frame in a family and shows their contradictions and their love for each other simultaneously. The actors have done a great job, the movie is compact and interesting till the end. The only weakness in my opinion is that the climax does not meet the expectation set by the rest of the film.

245,sreetanu-00094,AWESOME MOVIE,1,17 October 2021,"People who believe in the doctrine that remake movies mean bad things cannot be called movie lovers
I have recently watched the movie
everyone's works are great
There is nothing wrong with re-presenting a well-known story
Jeet's acting is speechless & Mimi has improved a lot in acting
Sabyasachi sir also winned everyone's heart by his acting and dialoguesWhen someone else remakes a movie they are not criticized but people criticized when Jeet daa does a remake movie
We, Jeet Fans, are always by his side.

253,Debajyoti_Guha,Bengal's 500DoS or VCB,1,14 April 2021,"Extremely underrated by regular movie-goers in search of stupid old love stories. This movie is the beginning of new-wave bengali rom-com. This is perhaps the first bengali rom-com where the Manic-Pixie-Dream-Girl trope has been given a character of flesh-and-blood like Summer of 500DoS. The backdrop being a Portuguese/Dutch colony of Chandernagore may also be a tribute to Vicky-Christina-Barcelona which matches with the nuances of the central characters in this movie thematically.And the showstealer? Khogen, the mongrel.This movie maturely handles the three types of love in Pablo's life. One that is conditional but settling, one that is unbounded but unsettling and one that is unbounded and unconditional .Are you excited to see how it goes with Pablo?",Prem Tame,tt12613748

257,drsombitbandyopadhyay,2 hours of my life that I'll never get back,1,16 April 2021,"This is one of those movies that clearly demonstrates how much the quality of Bengali movies have fallen over the years.There's barely 30mins of story and that's not even uniformly spread out. The movie started as fast paced, and soon they ran out of story then the whole movie started dragging.But there's a limit to how much you can drag without a story. So I guess the director gathered a team to brainstorm on what else can they do to lengthen the duration to 2 hours. Soon after the initial 45 minutes the movie changed into a sort of a tour guide of the historic places of Chandannagar. That went on for some time.Once they ran out of the tourist spots, the movie started to become even more dragging. The director seemed absolutely clueless on how to spend the time.And even if you somehow manage to drag on hoping for a climactic end, be warned, there is none.So don't make the same mistake I did. Don't waste your time.Bengali directors keep complaining that Tollywood is dying because the people don't support regional movies anymore, but that's absolutely not true. Directors like this the ones dragging the industry down.",Prem Tame,tt12613748

259,akbrahmo,Prem TAME,5,14 May 2021,"The film at least in initial phase had promised to grow into a taut movie on ""Love"" in different hues and depths. Pablo is like any of typical ' Bengali' boys who fall in love, from class six onwards regularly, with multiple beauties! ( being a probashi bong from Delhi and now living in poschim bangla, can safely say Premtame is the most loved pastime here). It can be cerebral love as well as shallow relationships( as Pablo has with Arshi & Raji). There is no depth in their togetherness. Didn't follow why Raji had to be shown as a PhD student! She as Pablo and Arshi's classmate would have looked more believable. Everything was developing into a cute plot( with Soumyo, Shweta and Sushmita doing their parts well), enters from nowhere Khagen, the canine( wanted to say dog but then the 5-7 or 8"" Raji was breathing down my neck- am 5-5""). He is the kabab mei haddi! Very possessive of his mentor Raji. From that point, it became an animal film which kids would enjoy immensely.Raji is on her own trip- on a quest to discover the unknown? Don't know.D√©nouement is long and it drags. We wish when the film would end. A promising to be plot, was murdered as a bong would put it. Soumyo and Sushmita are good actors, especially the latter. Konkona is wasted as usual. She should concentrate on film making.By Anindyo's standards it was a TAME affair.",Prem Tame,tt12613748

Screenplay is on a slower side. Movie could be easily trimmed by 20 mins. Movie has been stretched unnecessarily. Some silly scenes made serious situation look unintentionally funny which is not good for any movie. As far as acting is concerned only the foreign villain and Anirban was good. Overall GOLONDAAJ is a one time watch and below expectations.,Golondaaj,tt11755300

That is the best part... And it's a kind of film u can go and enjoy with your friends as well as family! This kind of film is a historical lesson to all , and that is being presented as such a entertainment! Don't miss it! It's a must-watch film!!

281,shahemtiaj,"Golondaaj, Dev",1,11 October 2021,"How's the story in the picture? From an early age, Nagendra's (Dev's) meditation was football. He was the first Indian to set foot in football. He formed about 12/13 clubs. In 180 Nagendra formed the Wellington Club. But the 'Native Indians' had no place in the British game. Nagendra's promise was to defeat the British in the game. Nagendra started the 'Wellington' club in association with 'Friends', 'Boys' and 'Presidency' clubs, but for some reason it broke up. Durand Cup is not played. Later, Nagendra, along with Raja Ananda krishna Dev and other powerful people, formed the Shobha bazar Club. And dreams of playing in the 'Trades Cup' final. Where his main opponent is Major Jackson's team. The stage of Nagendra s team formation has come up nicely in the film. Football is a team game. Nagendra can show the direction, victory does not come in a single fight! People from all walks of life took place in his group. Going beyond the caste-religion division, Nagendra prasad dream XI was created.........‚ù§",Golondaaj,tt11755300

285,dipsaha-21497,Worth it or not,1,11 October 2021,"Tbh it's a great movie. Every actor and actress did their job brilliantly, everyone nailed their character. Yes this movie has some plot holes but you can ignor them. But I wish this movie release in other indian languages especially in hindi. It's a crime that this movie isn't available in other languages. If you are a sports lover or you love to watch sports biopic, then this movie is for you. I watched this movie in the 2nd day of the release in INOX. My INOX experience isn't top of the level but this isn't the movie's fault. In one word go for the movie, you won't regard. It's worth it for every audience no matter you love sports or not but if you love sports then you'll definitely enjoy this movie.Note: I'm not been paid for this review.

He gets hold of a demented scriptwriter. He thinks Bengali crowd would easily digest the crap. Or at least the producer thinks. Hooks on few standard actors. Though Saswata Chatterjee and Sayoni Ghosh try to do justice to the script as they have been paid, Rudranil Ghosh with his over acting messes everything.

The problem is being highlighted in the context of police action crime in the context of Bangladesh. An important historical documentation is given at the beginning of the film to highlight the problem which will help the viewer to understand the story of the movie.The screenplay of the movie was awesome. All the characters are shown on the screen. There are a few bomb blast scenes in the movie that I found a little lacking in editing. However, nothing more can be done as a Bangladeshi movie.Arifin Shuvo's performance was good enough. Oishee's performance seemed a little lacking to me. However, it cannot be expected to be better than the first movie. And everyone else's acting was serious and natural.In the end, I would say that despite the fact that the movie has some negative aspects, I think that the producers have made a different kind of movie in Bengali.",Mission Extreme,tt11297214

312,shrabonroy-00129,Huge Dissapointment!,4,3 December 2021,"Such a lame story. The whole storyline was so weak and predictable. The presentation of the whole story was so messed up. Whole story was inspired by Sacred Games. One of the scenes were fully inspired by Money Heist. There was lots of usless casting for usless characters which was so much irritating. Action sequences were so low quality. Overall, i'm very disappointed.",Mission Extreme,tt11297214

Even far better than some of south indian action movie. Specially the hero Arifin shuvoo proved that he is world class and the casting was unbelievable.

Honestly, the thought of removing the eyes from the screen for even a moment did not come to mind
There is no question about acting, everyone from Mission Extreme - Mission Extreme team gave their best, especially Arifin Shuvo, Oishee, Sadia Nabila. Everyone's acting was great. And Waduda is the best of all time, I don't dare say anything about him.And the villain Taskin Rahman has completely cut, the voices, the expressions all fit together.Those who were members of the terrorist team also performed very well,At one point in the treasury, there were many comments about BGM, which is very well presented in the movie.Many thanks to director Faisal Ahmed and Sunny Sanwar Sir for presenting the whole movie so well.And the wait for Mission Extreme Part Two has increased even more, thanks.",Mission Extreme,tt11297214

The captain of the ship Avijatrik, Subhrajit Mitra showcased so beautifully, with care that I felt like I was a part of Apu's journey. Bikram Ghosh gave such a bgm that it goes on in mind even after the movie ends just like Pather Panchali. Arjun Chakraborty was probably the best cast as Apu. Every other casts were too apt especially Sabyasachi Chakraborty. This film will surely win hearts after its theatrical release.

324,suprabhattacharya,Wasted potential,6,13 October 2021,"Bony is a missed potential because of the promise it evokes from the beginning. The film starts well ,the sequence of the events seems believable,it doesn't overdo anything,the characters behave rationally in the first half. The landslide begins in the second act ,where audience intelligence are completely butchered by atrocious writing.The main problem with the film that it is aiming for happy crowd pleasing ending. These type of approaches have ruined several films before and 'Bony"" adds to the list.The story of the same name was written by Shirshendu Mukhopadhay thirty years ago,kudos to the man for taking such a unique concept to write. If the story wasn't there the film would have been more worse. The story has helped the film to maintain its rationality in the beginning but when the film deviates from it's source it fails miserably. Koel Mallick's performance is very good,her role as a mother has been perfect and that's unarguably the best part of the film. Paramabrata Chattopadhyay's performance is surprisingly half baked,he seems distracted form the role. Kanchan Mallick's comic timings has been used well in the film and his scenes were at least enjoyable. In Bengali films,the casting of pathetic foreign actors has been a habit and in this film that issue is not solved. Their scenes seems so off putting.The action sequences are horrible and the overbearing music during those scenes make those scenes more miserable. In some moments,the visual effects are good considering the budget.60/100.",Bony,tt10545298
325,manojitbaidya,New Era Of Bengali Films,8,16 October 2021,"I'm really very happy that Bengali Film Industry is making movies on this kind of content. It based on a great story written by Shirshendu Mukhopadhyay. Screenplay & direction is good. Lead actress Koel Mallik's performance is outstanding. Climax makes us a little disappointed. Over all the film is good and worth to watch in theater.

I'm pleased to say that EXTRACTION is their biggest and best one yet, a large budget slice of action spectacle with an excellent setting in Dhaka. The Bangladeshi city is brought to life the same way that Morocco was in the third BOURNE film, with all the bustle and sights and sounds.Chris Hemsworth, always the most charismatic of the AVENGERS, is a great choice for the taciturn lead and he really throws himself into the brawling, bruising action scenes. The story is nothing special, we've seen it done a million times before, but the direction is fresh and vibrant and the action choreography is excellent. The two highlights are the lengthy chase sequence at the mid point, which utilises all kinds of heavy camera work, camera tricks, and stunt doubles to truly convince, and of course the immersive bridge spectacle at the climax. What a delight to see America finally catching up with the likes of China's WOLF WARRIOR 2 in terms of films featuring lavish, wide-scale thrills and spills.",Extraction,tt8936646
338,SnoopyStyle,Rambo it up,6,14 May 2020,"Ovi Mahajan is the son of an imprisoned drug lord in Mumbai. He gets kidnapped and held prisoner in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Mercenary Tyler Rake (Chris Hemsworth) is recruited to rescue the boy.Sam Hargrave is the stunt coordinator for the Russo brothers and they seem to have given him his first chance at directing a full length feature. He does a perfectly adequate job with the highlight being the action sequences as one would expect from an experienced stunt coordinator. That's not to say that this is one stunt after another. There are some good stuff in between. The exterior locations are exotic. There are some good Indian actors in the villain roles. The roof top scene with the kids is fun. I would suggest a different way to go with Ovi. I would go younger and make it a girl to heighten the danger. It should be Man on Fire. One thing that does occur to me. Hemsworth is doing his Rambo in this movie and he could do the remake.

Here Chris Hemsworth reduces the population of Dhaka in Bangladesh instead of Mexico.Chris Hemsworth plays Tyler Rake.

He has the police and army in Dhaka in his pocket.Saju is an ex forces operator who was hired to protect Ovi by his father. He brought in Rake and his team for the extraction but then does not pay them. Instead double crossing them and Saju plans to bring the boy back to India.Tyler finds himself alone with Ovi and fighting off Saju and Amir's men.Extraction is an high octane action movie from Sam Hargrave, a stuntman and stunt action coordinator turned director. He was the second unit director for Avengers: Endgame.Hargrave places heavy reliance on action sequences which in some ways reminiscent of the John Wick films. It also has the kind of video game violence that director David Ayer is known for in films such as Fury and End of Watch.It is not the most original of stories but it is a fine enough action film.

342,kosmasp,Getting most of it,7,19 May 2020,"Pun intended I reckon. But this movie is a straight up action movie. Therefor you may not be too hyped about the overall simple story of it all. It does have great action and stunt scenes and that is what matters with a movie like this, right? It is definitely the mark and bar you should set.Yes there can be better movies out there, but if you look for a quick fix, this will give it to you. No question asked - some puns intended. Thor may be pigeonholed to a degree, but we know he can do other stuff too. In this case his character is quite thinly made - and nothing more is needed

343,Tweekums,Full on hostage rescue action,9,28 April 2020,"When Ovi Mahajan Jr, the teenage son of a jailed Indian drug lord is snatched from the streets of Mumbai and taken to Dhaka by a Bangladeshi drug lord Tyler Rake is called in to rescue him. Tyler is former Australian SAS but is haunted by the loss of his own son. Once in Dhaka he manages to retrieve the boy from his captors but getting him safely out of the city won't be easy. His erstwhile kidnapper is determined to get him back and he controls a corrupt police colonel who shuts down the city to hunt for them... if that weren't enough Saju, a former member of Indian special forces working for the boy's father, is determined to take to boy to avoid paying for the rescue.It must be stated the plot is both unlikely and rather simple... that doesn't matter though; it is there to provide a reason for the action and that action is great. From start to finish the action barely lets up... much of what happens from the moment of Rake rescues Ovi feels as if it is set in real time with camera work that puts the viewer right in the middle. Instead of the frequent cuts favoured by some directors we gets scenes that look like a single take. The action includes numerous shootings, chases on foot and in vehicles and a near-obligatory exploding helicopter. Chris Hemsworth really impresses as Tyler Rake as does Randeep Hooda as Saju; the rest of the cast are solid enough too. With its near non-stop violence this certainly won't be for everybody but if you want an action movie and enjoyed films like 'John Wick' and 'The Raid' this is sure to appeal to you.",Extraction,tt8936646
344,paul_haakonsen,Guns blazing and an abundance of action...,6,27 October 2021,"I was recommended to watch the 2020 action thriller ""Extraction"" by a friend, so of course I did so. Actually I hadn't even heard about ""Extraction"" before my friend spoke to me about it. But then again, I am not an avid fan of Chris Hemsworth, so I suppose that is why.But as my friend praised the movie highly, I must admit that I was having a certain amount of expectations for this movie from director Sam Hargrave. And I will say that writer Joe Russo actually managed to churn out a rather entertaining action plot.Sure, the storyline was rather simplistic actually, bordering on being near non-existing. But the sheer amount of action sequences and the dynamic way that the movie was shot more than made up for the lack of a deeper and profound storyline. I must say that I thoroughly enjoyed the way the movie was shot, making it feel like I was right there in the action. Some accomplishment from the cinematography people here.""Extraction"" is not a movie that relies heavily on a sound storyline, as it is all the action that does the talking. So having an excessive character gallery and good dialogue wasn't in the drivers seat here. But again, the action made up for those shortcomings.If you enjoy action movies, then you should definitely sit down to watch ""Extraction"", as it was an adrenaline-filled movie from start to end. However, this is hardly a movie that warrants more than just a single viewing, as the contents of the story just doesn't have the contents for that.I am rating ""Extraction"" a solid six out of ten stars.",Extraction,tt8936646
345,CinemaSerf,More of a filling than an extraction....,6,26 April 2020,"So it looks like Netflix have drafted in Chris Hemsworth to help them open up some lucrative business opportunities on the sub-continent with this action-packed, but totally derivative thriller set in Bangladesh. The young son of an imprisoned drug lord is kidnapped and Hemsworth and a team of mercenaries are hired to retrieve him and restore him to his family. What ensues are a series of tightly-shot, almost claustrophobic, set-piece action scenes - loads of extended fights, explosions and injuries that would long since have killed anyone but our intrepid rescuer. There is no jeopardy at any stage, with only a casual nod at character development, the script is all but irrelevant and the music, surprisingly non-commercial - but the film is nonetheless an enjoyable enough watch.

347,view_and_review,Give Me More,9,10 December 2020,"What a rush. What a thrill. What poetic violence.After movies like this, ""6 Underground,"" ""Ronin,"" and others, can we please have more movies set in foreign countries? Let's break away from the monotony of New York, L.A., and Chicago and go international: Mumbai, Tokyo, Lagos.The premise of the movie is simple and it's all in the title. A skilled mercenary named Tyler (Chris Hemsworth) has been contracted to extract a drug dealer's kidnapped son. It's pretty much a suicide mission, but Tyler didn't need even the slightest coaxing to take the job. He didn't even ask the price. Some odd hours later he's in Bangladesh, kid in tow, shooting his way out of a sticky situation.This ballsy grimy film took you through the muck in style. The camera angles and continuous action shots were fresh as it followed Tyler from one point to the next while he shot and fought John Wick style to his extraction point. ""Extraction"" was raw at times, shocking at other times, and even moving at times. It's a no frills visceral form of action that keeps you at the edge of your seat and constantly engaged. Ooooh! give me more.",Extraction,tt8936646
348,ferguson-6,action escapism,6,24 April 2020,"Greetings again from the darkness. The description for this movie labels lead character Tyler Rake ""a fearless black market mercenary."" Now I've personally never shopped for a mercenary, but my assumption is that every one of them is 'black market', and none would likely self-identify as anything other than 'fearless.' My Facebook account is inundated with unwanted advertisements, and I've yet to see one for any mercenary, much less one that lacks courage. Now you likely find this to be worthless meanderings, but that's where the first feature length film from director Sam Hargrave took me. Mr. Hargrave is a veteran stunt coordinator and stunt performer (he's been the stunt double for Chris Evans' Captain America), and he's working from a script by Joe Russo (director and producer of the last two Avengers movies and the last two Captain America movies).Chris Hemsworth (THOR) stars as the aforementioned Tyler Rake. It's a role that would have just as easily worked for Jason Statham or, in past years, Bruce Willis, Sylvester Stallone, or Arnold Schwarzenegger. Rake is a live action hero, haunted by visions and dreams of better times. His fighting prowess, shooting skills, and willingness to play roulette with his own life, make him the perfect hire for imprisoned drug lords when their son is kidnapped by a rival drug lord. And that's exactly what happens.The film opens with Tyler in a bad spot. He's injured and trying to shoot his way out of a mess where he's badly outnumbered. The film then flashes back a couple of days where we witness the kidnapping of Ovi Jr (Rudrhaksh Jaiswal) by Amir Asif (Priyanshu Painyuli), the drug lord rival to Ovi Jr's imprisoned father. We also see Tyler, after a few too many drinks, take a running leap off a 30 meter cliff into an Australian lake. Soon he's visited by Nik (Golshifteh Farahani, Adam Driver's wife in PATERSON). She acts as his handler for the dangerous jobs, and few are more risky than extracting Ovi Jr.What follows are fast-paced car chases through the dusty streets of Dhaka, bone-crunching hand-to-hand combats, and more shootouts than we've seen in a while. Tyler's job is to extract Ovi Jr and deliver him safely home. When things go sideways, the two end up on the run from an entire army, and take cover in a local sewer ... with all the sights and smells you might imagine. Supporting roles are covered by David Harbour as Tyler's old friend, and Randeep Hooda as Ovi Sr's right-hand man.As you might expect, there are double-crosses and plenty of opportunities for Tyler to show off his 'fearless' mercenary skills. Ovi Jr is a bit of a nerd, but does offer up some life philosophy for his troubled protector: ""You drown not by falling in the water, but by staying submerged in it."" The kill count here is extraordinarily high and literally thousands of rounds get fired. What's most surprising, however, is that Tyler's cell phone somehow survives his many falls, gunshots, sewage, and car collisions. It's much more impressive than the old Timex commercials. Gifted cinematographer Newton Thomas Sigel (X-MEN movies, DRIVE, THREE KINGS, THE USUAL SUSPECTS) does an admirable job capturing the action sequences; it's just that this is too similar to many movies we've seen before, though it serves as a chance for Hemsworth to be something other than Thor. For those in need of an action flick fix after all this social distancing, EXTRACTION should scratch the itch.",Extraction,tt8936646

The plot if there is any is simple it's all about the extraction. Just around one hour the action slows down and we do go into characterisation to move further in part 2 of brutal action.But just have a look at the cinematograhy, that is really stunning. At the end, a no-brainer with a lot of blood.

350,deloudelouvain,"Good action scenes, the plot is a bit weak as usual with these kind of movies.",7,14 August 2020,"If you want to watch a movie with an interesting story this isn't the one but if you're just looking for some action then Extraction is worth a watch. The story is pretty basic, nothing you have to think about, just some machos shooting around. That said the action scenes are good, above the mediocre stuff we're sometimes bombarded with, but you can't be too picky as there will be some guys being run over by cars, shot at plenty of times and still moving around like they can't be hurt. If you can manage those kind of scenes you're in for some well shot action scenes. It's mostly about Chris Hemsworth that fits perfectly as the untouchable hero macho warrior. Extraction is just easy popcorn entertainment with a cast that did a pretty good job, with some great action scenes that are well choreographed, and some quality cinematography. They didn't spare any expenses shooting those action scenes, it's all quality. That said don't expect a deep story, it's not there, so if it's that you're looking then for just skip this one. I enjoyed it as will do others that aren't too picky.",Extraction,tt8936646
351,siderite,An above average action movie,8,6 August 2020,"Chris Hemsworth to the rescue! An action packed film taking place in India that looks and feels like a shooter video game. The legions of heavily armed yet easily killed enemies, the switch from shooting to stabbing to sniping to reckless driving that seems to happen to everybody at the same time, the evil mastermind, the henchmen and you, the killer of dozens, saving the life of a kid. It's a nice action film, but completely pointless otherwise.Bottom line: I am glad that after 20 years from Way of the Gun they rediscovered how to do shooting scenes. As an action film it's a success. Don't look for anything above that.

353,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"Derivative, unimaginative time waster",4,4 May 2020,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningTyler Rake (Chris Hemsworth) is a burnt out mercenary, who's assigned to rescue Ovi (Rudhraksh Jaiswal), the intelligent son of a notorious gangster, who's currently holed up in jail. After successfully completing this mission, he finds the kidnappers aren't as willing to relinquish their hostage as he'd hoped, plunging him into a deadly battle through the streets of Dhaka, where everything is not as it seems, and he can trust no one.As cinemas around the country (and the world, of course) are closed in the lockdown, streaming services like Netflix are going to be more popular than ever, as people, and certainly film lovers, will crave the sense of escapism that the filmic experience provides even more than they usually do. And, indeed, the main function of a film like Extraction will be to escape to another world, because there will never be any sense of realism in some action film where one man takes on a whole bunch of villains and defeats them without getting a scratch, the ones popularised so greatly throughout the 80s and 90s. Which the feature length directorial debut of Sam Hargrave ultimately emerges as one, big generic regurgitation of.Hargrave saturates everything with the standard present day dark, moody style, with a gloomy, blurred shooting style, setting the overall tone for the film itself. If it hadn't been so heavy and humourless, and a little shorter and less self indulgent, it could have passed as a harmless, run of the mill actioner, something to nod off to late at night, but instead it's one big, overblown event that seems to be stabbing at something deeper. Hemsworth is effective and convincing as an action hero, there's a depressingly authentic recreation of the Indian slums and it livens up at the end, with some pretty decent action, but it all amounts to the same thing.There's an Aladdin's cave of these type of movies in the back catalogue of films from the 80s and 90s, and there's plenty you can seek out, which will be over and done with much quicker and give you much the same experience. Usually starring Steven Seagal or Jean Claude Van Damme. **",Extraction,tt8936646
354,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Extra action.,6,26 April 2020,"The highlight of 'Extraction (2020)' is a very extended, practically seamless but sometimes dizzying 'one-shot' action scene that careens from a car-chase to a shootout to a fistfight and back into a car-chase again, the camera confidently swerving around and sometimes diving into the chaos it captures. It's during this sequence that the sheer impressiveness of the filmmaking - the complex camerawork, the tight choreography, the painful stunts - begins to outweigh the piece's narrative shortcomings. Unfortunately, those shortcomings really are quite significant and they start to seep back into the fray once the film inevitably cuts away from its magnum opus. Really, the story is about as bare-bones as you can get, with its generic characters and often-seen situations serving only to get it from set-piece to set-piece. To start with, the flick is actually rather dull. Even the first action sequence doesn't feel impactful because you don't care about anyone involved with it. After a certain point, though, the thing becomes a lot more engaging. It starts to seep some actual character from the gaps in its violence and, even if this is still basic stuff, it helps carry you through to the end of the slightly-too-long plot. The movie takes itself pretty seriously but it's still firmly in the realm of 'turn your brain off' fun. It's rather exciting when it gets going and, ultimately, it is enjoyable. It's lucky that the action is as genuinely good as it is, because it's the only thing that will keep you watching. 6/10",Extraction,tt8936646
355,MOscarbradley,Better than I expected.,7,16 August 2020,"""Extraction"" is a big, mostly dumb and very violent action flic that has the common sense not to try to be anything else and is actually a surprisingly good example of its kind, providing, of course, that this is the kind of thing you like. The plot is simple; the action relentless. A Mumbai drug-lord's son is kidnapped and it's up to mercenary Chris Hemsworth to get him back. Neither he nor the film hang around. As I've said, it's both violent and relentless; a non-stop catalogue of killings and mutilations, choreographed to bloody perfection by first-time director Sam Hargrave. Of course, there isn't a frame that's actually believable. This is a live-action video game, based on a graphic novel, brilliantly photographed by Newton Thomas Sigel in and around Dhaka and with enough good guys and bad guys killing each other relentlessly to keep it on the boil for two hours. Brains may be largely in short supply but there's certainly no shortage of brawn.

Great action, serviceable story (but no true substance) with a movie star at the center. A movie you watch on a saturday afternoon while trying to relax. Hemsworth hasn't chosen the best projects outside of the MCU and this film is more of the same. I really do wonder if his career will veer more into comedy as the years go by, since that is clearly a major strength of his. Extraction is solid, but it certainly isn't fulfilling my desire for the summer blockbuster (which we've been lacking because of COVID). Oh well.6.8/10

358,Cineanalyst,Netflix Continues to Corner Market on Lousy Action Flicks,4,29 April 2020,"Even before the world, cinemas included, closed for business during the current pandemic, the economics of going to theatres to see movies had become increasingly limited--mostly relying on tent-pole franchise installments. Disney owns a huge chunk of this business with childhood fare: remakes of their cartoons, MCU superheroes, etc. Not only have these new dynamics largely squeezed out the mid-budget drama from multiplexes, but also the traditional, usually stand-alone, macho action flicks such as ""Extraction,"" and ""Bright"" (2017), and ""Triple Frontier,"" and ""Red Sea Diving Resort,"" and ""6 Underground"" (all 2019). Now, if it's not already part of a series, chances are you'll only get this lack-of-a-brand type of adrenaline injection from streaming services and at home. Unfortunately, ""Extraction"" is a mostly generic burger of a movie from MCU veterans taking a break before making ""Avengers 83,"" or whatever.Stunt choreographer Sam Hargrave gets a chance to direct, and his background in filming fighting moves, along with the similar skills of the Russo brothers and Thor himself, Chris Hemsworth, shows. The next movie I saw after this one was ""Angel Has Fallen"" (2019), and it's painfully clear that the makers here put care into their craft, whereas the hacks behind the other one, despite it getting a wide theatrical release before making its way to Netflix, were merely there to cash checks. So, I do appreciate the action scenes here--especially the virtuoso, lengthy one-shot car chase.Otherwise, though, ""Extraction"" is a lousy entry in the trope of the White Savior. Others have commented how poorly the picture represents Dhaka, which just demonstrates how little filmmakers of white-savoir rubbish care about depicting the racial other. Narratively, only the white male hero's journey is made to matter--how sympathetic he is to the supposed plight of the Oriental, as opposed to their actual state of affairs or characterizations. Blah, I prefer my white-savior myths to have some knowing humor and time-traveling, purple Malthusian giants. If for little else, ""Extraction"" is helpful for realizing how much I miss fat Thor.",Extraction,tt8936646

Most of the Indians don't speak English.There is a lot of bullets and bloodshed. This is the first time children get harmed on screen. Which makes it realistic and unPC. Children are used as fearless mercenaries. Thor isn't afraid to harm them either.This movie is not made for children of these days. They'd get puny nightmares.The movie showed a lot of the slums of India. As well shown how corrupt the authorities can be.1 fault I dislike movies that start at the end then goes back to the beginning. Its basically a spoiler.Verdict: Its a good mouse and cat kind of movie. A lot of action and violence.,Extraction,tt8936646
362,The-Sarkologist,Pretty Action Packed,6,7 May 2020,"Yep, another Netflix movie, but that is probably because that is all we really have these days, since the cinemas are all closed, and all of the upcoming releases have been put on hold. So, what we have are these films that are appearing on Netflix, such as this one, not that I am stretched for anything to watch.This film confused me a bit because in part I thought that it was some Bollywood production, but it turns out that it is definitely an American film, though since Chris Hemsworth takes the leading role, I probably shouldn't have been too surprised. Yet, pretty much all of the other characters, with the exception of a couple of the protagonist's team, were Indian.The story is pretty straight forward, namely that the son of a drug dealer is kidnapped and taken to Bangladesh, and Hemsworth is hired to bring him back. As such, we pretty much end up having this huge action movie which is little more than Hemsworth verse the entire Dhaka police force. Yeah, it is a bit like though, though there are a couple of other antagonists thrown in, and a couple of twists as well.In a way it pretty much reminded me a lot of Blackhawk Down, namely that Hemsworth is attempting to get out of Dhaka the quickest way possible, and cities like Dhaka aren't the easiest to get around, especially when you have the entire police force after you, and being American (or in the case here, Australian), you do stand out quite a lot.Look, it isn't one of the best films out there, but it certainly does work well to keep you up with your weekly dose of action, especially since it is one of those films that is somewhat new. Look, the plot isn't that great, but the production certainly does work quite well, and it certainly does look a lot better than a number of other productions that have landed up here. The other thing is that the acting isn't too bad either. However, as I mentioned, it isn't particularly original.",Extraction,tt8936646

There is a brilliantly choreographed knife fight in the middle of a street.Great performances, great practical stunts!!Recommended

364,Thanos_Alfie,Save the boy...,6,1 May 2020,"""Extraction"" is an Action - Thriller movie in which we watch a man who is a member of an elite team trying to save a young boy's life after he was kidnapped by a crime lord. The boy's father who is also an international crime lord but he is in prison hired them to save his son but he does not know everything about them or his opponent and what they are both capable of.I have to admit that I did not have high expectations from this movie but I was happily surprised by it. I liked it because of its plot which was very interesting, it had plenty of action and much of suspense. The interpretation of Chris Hemsworth who played as Tyler Rake was very good and he showed us why it was the right choice for this movie. Some other good interpretations that have to be mentioned were Rudhraksh Jaiswal's who played as Ovi Mahajan and Golshifteh Farahani's who played as Nik Khan. If you are a fan of action movies then you should definitely watch this movie because you won't be disappointed and you will enjoy it.",Extraction,tt8936646
365,cruise01,"Action packed, Chris Hemsworth is brutal, and all out thrilling.",8,24 April 2020,"(4 out of 5 stars).Extraction is an action packed thrill ride. Definitely one of those films you set aside any character development or story. Just enjoy the action flick for what it is. Chris Hemsworth leads the role and he can take on a heroic character. Like how Keanu Reeves leads John Wick. Hemsworth takes a beating. He uses guns, objects, or knives in any fight he can get into. Chris Hemsworth plays a mercenary, who is assigned to rescue a drug lords son in Dhaka. While the kidnappers who puts a huge bounty on the sons life which has the corrupt police, military, and other henchmen all after the son and Chris Hemsworth. The film is action packed. The director can manage the action sequences. It is brutal. And there is one long take with the action scene that was impressive. The character Ovi (Rudhraksh Jaiswal) who is the drug lord son. I will say the weakest thing about the movie is Rudhraksh Jaiswal performance. It was hard to understand his dialogue with all the mumbling every time he spoke.Otherwise, Extraction is a good action film. Chris Hemsworth is great. The film is non stop with the exciting brutal action. If your into shoot em up films like John Wick. Than this movie would be for you.",Extraction,tt8936646
366,eddie_baggins,Another cookie-cutter Netflix actioner with some above average set-pieces,4,30 April 2020,"Currently one of the most savvy and successful businesses in the world, with a model that knows exactly what its audience wants and delivers entirely too that, Netflix have been churning out sleek and fast-paced action films ad nauseam over the last few years, with their new adrenaline fueled tentpole Extraction fitting the modus operandi perfectly.Backed by Marvel hero's the Russo brothers, with Joe penning the script and directed by long-time Marvel stunt coordinator and performer Sam Hargrave, Extraction is an instantly familiar action experience that sees Chris Hemsworth's downtrodden but Thor-like Australian mercenary Tyler Rake end up in Bangladesh trying to rescue the son of an Indian crime lord who has been kidnapped by a rival operator.Anyone that has ever seen an action thriller with a seemingly cold-hearted and depressive central figure, whose also a one man killing machine, will know exactly where Extraction is taking us, as the mission Rake is on goes sour and he is forced to take down what feels like a city worth of bad guys to protect his new mate Ovi.Similar at times to Man on Fire, Mile 22 and filmed in a way that feels like a direct rip-off of The Raid franchise (in what is becoming the normal now for Hollywood films trying to replicate the energy and frenetic nature of those action classics), Extraction fails to bring anything new to the table as Hargrave ticks off a serious of boxes on his way to an all too familiar conclusion.It's not to say there aren't little action delights along the journey Rake takes, with a clearly CGI'd but none the less impressive unbroken action set piece around the 30 minute mark of the film one of the candidates for the best action showcases of the year but there's far too much of Extraction that is forgettable, unbelievable and tiresome to bring it home with a bang.This forgettable film nature is a trend that Extraction lead and beloved Aussie icon Chris Hemsworth needs to pay close attention to, with his work outside of the Marvel universe and the well-liked but financial failure Rush is cause for concern.Films like Blackhat, In the Heart of the Sea, 12 Strong and Bad Times at the El Royale might not be the worst films going around but their far from the type of products you'd want littering your career for too many more years to come.Final Say -Some nice action moments are to be found in Extraction but outside of that this charmless and unimaginative action thriller is the exact type of Netflix outing that is still too prevalent for a company looking to reach for the low hanging fruit too often.2 garden rakes out of 5",Extraction,tt8936646
367,Top_Dawg_Critic,"Jason Bourne meets Call of Duty, in Mumbai",9,4 May 2020,"Wow shocked at the undeserving low score! This is stunt actor Sam Hargrave's first full length feature film sitting in the directors chair, and he nailed it. Outstanding action/fight choreography, great cinematography, perfect pacing for the 116 min runtime, and all around great performances, especially Hemsworth's kick-ass character. I'm reading the reviews about no plot... seriously? Just because there's no surprising unpredictable plot twist doesn't mean there's no plot. It was a simple story, adapted into a screenplay from the graphic novel by Ande Parks, and presented on a bullet ridden testosterone plate. What more does anyone want for that perfect weekend popcorn action flick? I thoroughly enjoyed it! It's a well deserved 9/10 from me.

Extraction is a good choice if you like to watch such movies like John Wick, The Equalizer, Taken, or those golden oldies like Rambo and Die Hard.

369,digitalbeachbum,Writers and director are idiots,1,27 April 2020,"The intensity of the fight scenes and chase is good, but there are too many moments when they break the reality of the moment. There are too many cut scenes, and the switching between third person to first person is confusing. The cinematography is wonderful, there are plenty of wonderful landscape shots. It's the highlight of the movie.The casting is good. The direction was meh, but the script brings the movie down. Several of the characters are not believable. There is too much deus ex machina being used to move the movie forward.The combat and the combat strategy is flawed. I did not find it plausible the way they executed the story. Such as the street fight with the kids at night. No soldier would follow that path of logic. There was too much at risk. A real soldier like him would kill the kids and wouldn't use smoke bombs, which would instantly paint you.The main character keeps seeking attention. The logic was to be quiet and to use stealth. The two man team thing isn't realistic either.The sniper who got shot by the boat, where is the logic in that? A sniper would have held their position. They would not have gone to check out the boat.And there are far too many silencers in this movie.The sniper stuff at the end isn't even possible. The weapon used by the Colonel is not a sniper rifle and there was no way he is going to get four shots, three head shots, and one body shot at that range with the short barrel. He is using an HK SL8-6 assault rifle. With the scope, the accuracy is good for only a 100 (effective)-300 (max) yards. This is a weapon used for close quarters combat only. IT IS NOT A SNIPER RIFLE.Even the sniper rifle the woman is using is a limited range sniper rifle good for up to 800 yards (max). She is using the FN SCAR8 and there is no way she is going to kill anyone at that range.The range to that bridge is 3,000 to 3,500 yards. The drug dealer/kinpin can be seen using the binoculars at 1:40:00. You can see how extremely far away they are from the bridge. Not possible. Unrealistic.",Extraction,tt8936646
370,Fella_shibby,"We have seen the plot umpteenth no of times, the action is nothing extraordinary, the villains were typical Bollywood style n laughable, the ending a big meh.",6,4 May 2020,"Had expectations aft seeing the trailer but it all fizzled once the movie started playing.
It has a ridiculous story, tension n character development is nada.
I am totally surprised that inspite of this film being backed by Netflix, with amazing star cast, it lacked the substance.
The hand to hand combat with the knife is not thrilling. For the real deal (silat fighting) check out The Raid Redemption.
As a fan of Randeep Hooda, I am happy that he got a good role.
The babe is attractive.
The hint near the swimming pool at the end is again a big meh with the possible of a sequel.
Now that will be too much for a guy to survive with bullets pierced all over.

371,matthewssilverhammer,Poor-man's John Wick,7,17 November 2020,"There are times in a man's life when a straight-to-video / -Netflix / -Redbox action drama is just what the doctor ordered. This poor-man's John Wick is a sweaty, adrenaline-fueled adventure-thriller full of male bravado (and admittedly a heap of white-savior complexions). Forgettable? Sure, but something this easily accessible and simply engaging is always a welcome distraction...if nothing else, it's hard to deny the action, especially that one chase scene.

And there is not much action to speak of, at all. Lots of talk and lots of watching Liam Hemsworth sitting down somehwere waiting for another assignment. Quite boring. Almost 2 hours of watching this I eventually got incredibly bored. Action movie? No way!Not any good? Only recommended for diehard Liam Nemsworth fans, for those it might be an okay movie, but dont get your hopes up...The story: Liam Nemsworth is a hired gun in India.

374,southdavid,Thor-pe Park,6,13 May 2020,"Heavily promoted by Netflix at the moment, starring an Avenger, written by the ""Endgame"" directors and directed by the Avengers stunt co-ordinator, you might expect ""Extraction"" to be a low key gem. It isn't. Unfortunately it's largely run of the mill, but it does have a few great action sequences that elevate it above similar straight-to-video nonsense.Ovi Mahajan (Rudhraksh Jaiswal), son of an imprisoned Indian drug lord, is kidnapped by Amir Asif (Priyanshu Painyuli) his father's Bangladeshi rival. Knowing that he'll be held to account for this, Saju (Randeep Hooda) a lieutenant in the Indian family and Ovi's guardian engages a crack mercenary team to extract the boy. The team, with Tyler Rake (Chris Hemsworth) on point, successfully rescue Ovi, but soon discover that Asif's massive influence of the Police, Army and his own street gangs make getting out almost impossible.As I said in the opening paragraph, there are a few action scenes in this film that are much better than the overall film deserves. The rescue scene is visceral exciting close combat stuff, but it was the later driving scene where I really started to take notice - particularly of the excellent camera work. The camera tracks the vehicle, circulates to the front when the car needs to reverse and then, in a bravura move, enters the car and sits on the back seat. There are a number of ""John Wick"" type gun fights for the remainder of the film which, whilst never quite hitting the heights of that franchise, are OK.That said, the rest of the film is a pretty predictable and generic thriller and you'll see the twists and plot points coming a mile off. I can understand why it had Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis attached at various points. Chris Hemsworth is OK, better than either of those would have been, even if it does feel like him playing ""sad action man"" is a bit of a waste, given his comedic talent. Randeep Hooda is given more of an arc, and provides a better performance because of it.Perfectly acceptable way to spend a couple of hours, but I'll never watch it again.",Extraction,tt8936646
375,Vartiainen,More films need to be directed by stuntmen,7,10 December 2020,"Extraction stars Chris Hemsworth and was produced by the Russo brothers. It was directed by Sam Hargrave in his directorial debut. He has previously made a career as a stuntman, most notably as a stunt coordinator in several Marvel movies. And that definitely shows in the film. This film contains some of the nicest action set pieces seen in years.Unfortunately, this comes at a price. Namely that of an interesting story. While the story of Extraction - a gun for hire (Hemsworth) shooting his way through Bangladesh in order to rescue the kidnapped son of a drug lord - is perfectly serviceable, it's also nothing to write home about. The characters are shallowly written and while they're acted well enough, the main attraction of the film are those action scenes.That being said, those are definitely good enough on their own to justify the price of admission. Hemsworth gives an electrifying performance as a man spread too thin by all the violence he has caused, while Randeep Hooda gives an equally memorable performance as his foil and counterpart.And it's just plain fun to watch. If you have a soft spot for those 80s action films such as Commando or Rambo, then this is definitely worth checking out.",Extraction,tt8936646
376,jtindahouse,A violent film with some seriously good action sequences,7,24 April 2020,"In a world that is currently minus new films, to get a fresh one delivered to us via Netflix was a much needed treat. And I'm glad to report that 'Extraction' was worth the wait. It isn't a flawless movie, but it certainly has some good things going for it. The action sequences were probably the highlight of the film for me. I'm not usually someone who appreciates or even notices good action sequences, but I did with this film which says something. There is one sequence that really blew me away. It is a one-shot sequence that goes on for quite some time and has some amazing ingenuity behind it. Definitely the highlight of the film.Chris Hemsworth was right at home in this role. He doesn't have to do a lot of speaking, and can just let his actions speak for themselves. Some of the stunt work in this film would not have been easy. When he is required to slow things down and have some dialogue in the odd scene he does so adequately.The film surprised me with just how violent it was willing to be at times, especially in scenes involving children. There were a couple of time where I thought - they're not going to do that are they? - and then sure enough they did. This is a very serious film as well. Very little (if any that I can think of) humour whatsoever makes an appearance.The film does get a little tedious towards the end. You can only watch so many people getting shot without becoming numb and a little bored by it. Also the film opens with a shot from near the end of the film. It doesn't work though because there is no intrigue behind it. This was one of the few poor choices an otherwise very good film made however.

377,subxerogravity,I hope I get to see movies like this in the theatres soon!,7,25 April 2020,"The recent quarantine has me going berserk. I love going to the movies so much and I miss seeing stuff on the big screen, so when I see good stuff like Extraction, it makes me a little depress that I only have a 32 itch screen to watch this on.I herd that Chris Hemsworth was actually tapped to star in an American adaption of the Indonesian film The Raid. I don't know if that movie will ever happen but Extraction is a good alternative. Watching Thor brawl through an army on the streets of Mumbai is too exciting, and they do these single cut action sequences that make me feel like they are crossing 1917 with a John Wick film.Produced by the Russo brothers who directed Hemsworth in Avengers: infinity War and Avengers End game, it feels like the Brothers are into solid action movies as they did one last year called 21 Bridges which also stared an Avenger, the Black Panther, Chadwick Bosman.The plot does not cut deep enough, but this movie is all about the visual energy coming from it. That's why it saddens me that I did not get to experience this in a dark theatre looking up at a huge screen, trying to stuff my face with popcorn and soda without take my eyes off the action.The movie theatres were made for these kinds of flicks and I can't wait to get back in those reclining seats.",Extraction,tt8936646

379,alindsay-al,A Good Brutal Action Film,7,27 April 2020,"With new movies few and far between at the moment we have to take them when we get them and there is a new film from Netflix starring Chris Hemsworth called Extraction and here is my review for the film. The premise of the film sees a special agent sent into Bangledesh to rescue a gangsters son from his rival.
Main Character
As mentioned above Chris Hemsworth is the main character in this film and he does a really good job. He is great in the action scenes, he is believable and is probably only second to John Wick in terms of his action skills, it is just really entertaining to see him go through multiple enemies and kill them in pretty gruesome ways. His character takes some time to be developed but he has enough depth to him to make you care and you do understand his motivations towards the end of the film.
Supporting Characters
David Harbour is probably the most recognisable supporting actor and he does a good job with the limited screen time he has, I bought into his character and Hemsworth's having a relationship and it worked. There is also a character called Saju who is hunting Hemsworth and he is like a Terminator in the action scenes taking down everybody in his path and he has a bit of character depth aswell. Unfortunatley though I didn't care about the boy as much as you are clearly meant to and I thought the villain of the film was incredibly basic and really had nothing interesting about him.
Story
The best parts of the story are some of the arcs that the characters have, they develop nicely and you understand their motivations, I also thought the ending of the film was well done and left you guessing as to what could come next. Though as you can probably tell from the premise this film has a very basic plot and one that you have seen plenty of times and it does very little to make you think you have seen anything new.Script
The script has some heartful moments to it and some well done dramatic moments but it doesn't have anything that reall stands out to it. Plus a film like this doesn't really have any humour which may have been better at times to help humanise Hemsworth and other characters.Style
The style of the film is awesome, the action scenes are pretty incredible. They are really well filmed and well choreographed, every hit feels brutal and seeing the inventive ways that people are killed is a joy to see. As mentioned it can be a bit gruesome but I thought it worked for the film an allowed them to be more creative, also it was nice to see Bangledesh used as the backdrop as it provided some unique action sequences.Overall
Overall, this is a good action film, if you want to see Hemsworth take out tonnes of guys then this is a film for you, it doesn't do anything to stand out too much but is an enjoyable film for sure.",Extraction,tt8936646

Nicely ambiguous ending, although I found the scene with David Harbour and unnecessary distraction.

382,arthur_tafero,Better Than Average Action Flick - Extraction,6,7 May 2020,"No, this is not a film about going to the dentist. However, the relentless action sequences might give you a migraine. They are well done, but the acting in the film is left to the professionals; that would be the Indian actors. The lead actor, unfortunately, has less range than John Wayne, and I think we all know what that means. The direction and production values make up for this deficiency, and the Indian character actors actually steal the film quite easily.
Think of the action sequences as eye candy and the main course of steak and potatoes is being done by the Indian actors. The street urchins of this Indian city were quite reminiscent of City of God, where orphans run rampant in Rio, Brail.
This aint your flying down to Rio film of the 30s. And Extraction isnt your usual overcoming bad odds battle; it is a bit unrealistic to think one man (even with the help of a highly trained team) can overcome an entire city of police and soldiers.

383,jimbo-53-186511,Hemsworth is a commanding presence in this reasonable actioner,6,11 July 2020,"When an imprisoned drug lord's son is kidnapped by a rival drug lord he tasks a close friend with the job of retrieving his son from his rival. Tyler Rake (Chris Hemsworth) is a black market mercenary hired to bring the drug lord's son home in what proves to be one of his toughest assignments to date...It's probably fair to say that if you choose to sit down and watch Extraction that you're unlikely to be blown away by its story; however if you are a fan of action films with plenty of shoot em up sequences then you should find this film to be relatively enjoyable.Arguably the biggest flaw with this film lies with the story itself; 2 drug lords are at war with each other but we're never really given any explanation as to what their beef is with each other? Still as I've said this doesn't really matter in the moment as there is always something happening in this film (shoot outs and fisticuffs come thick and fast in this picture) which, in fairness, is what you'd come to expect with films of this nature.Hemsworth does a solid job (he's a good physical presence, but unlike some of his counterparts that we see in action films he also does well from an 'acting' perspective as well). The villains are a little clich√©d, but nobody disgraces themselves here.Although it feels a little generic and underwritten the fast pace and neat actions sequences make it worthwhile.",Extraction,tt8936646
384,r96sk,The positives/negatives level out to make for good viewing,7,28 April 2020,"I do have mixed feelings towards this film, but by the end I think the positives/negatives level out to make for good viewing.The cast are fine. Chris Hemsworth is obviously the standout, though Randeep Hooda and Priyanshu Painyuli are also noteworthy here. Those three, and a few others, give more than solid performances but I don't feel like they are anything extraordinary - mainly due to other factors.That also matches how I feel about the action. I enjoyed a lot of it in truth, a number of the deaths are pretty nicely done, though the editing/cinematography comes out odd in parts... yet it does still weirdly work.The set designs are something I, flat out, don't rate in 'Extraction'. All of the major scenes in that regard feel fake, like they've been created from scratch to look like a war zone... √† la what you get in video games, comes across too rigged.This film's premise isn't the most original, you've seen it all before and it can feel dragged out, though this still makes for a mostly enjoyable experience.",Extraction,tt8936646

Hemsworth is excellent here & gives a fantastic tough as hell performance as troubled mercenary Tyler Rake & he's one extremely deadly & well trained Black market mercenary with a nothing to lose attitude & a fearless warrior instinct, a great character. Tyler has been hired to find & rescued a kidnapped boy who is held for ransom but the kid is the son of a crime lord. This is set in the dangerous & violent underworld city of Bangladesh & the action is bone crunching, frantic, gritty & full of realism. The town is locked down & full of gangs out hunting for Tyler & the boy (a good performance by Rudhrakish Jaiswal) & these two are ferociously hunted by not just the criminals of the ghettos but also by a deadly Assassin played by Randeep Hooda, a fantastic performance & one hell of a great character who is just as good as Chris Hemsworth here!!!I loved the scary & dangerous atmosphere & the frantic explosive action that bursts out of nowhere & makes everything feel on edge & intense.

Yes, the story is far-fetched and predictable, but execution-wise it's better than most movies in the particular genre. And Chris Hemsworth is very good in the lead role.

It wasn't engaging enough for me and all of the action wasn't anything new, except Christ Hemsworth kicking kids. There was that ""one"" take scene that was way too long and it felt unnecessary, it just kept going and going, I wish they finished it when the car chase ended. There are also cliche flashback beach scenes that don't contribute to anything plotwise. If it had more explosions it would've felt like a Bay film, instead we got another forgettable action movie (at least Bay films go all in).

Not for lack of trying on the writers' part, the bulk of quality in this is movie is Hemsworth shooting his way through India. The reasoning of which really isn't all that important, in fact, it is a designed adversity that he is trying to save a kid's life. Without even watching the movie, I could have told you it wasn't worth killing so many people to rescue one kid.The action is excellent and worth watching the rest of the movie: hell, you could even fast forward through the parts where they're not fighting. It reminded me a lot of Daredevil series, but focused on guns.If you want to see some good action, give this a go, but I can't guarantee the actual story is anything you'll really get into.",Extraction,tt8936646
395,Easygoer10,High Bodycount; Too High,8,27 April 2020,"This reminds me of ""Rambo 4"". With a body count well over 100, it's truly over the top. What is really bad is the credits are over 13 minutes long. That is worse than the ridiculously high amount of people shot, stabbed, etc. At least it wasn't revenge motivated. More of a ""who cares? type attitude from seeing too much death. Basically, a forgettable film. I should mention David Harbour turned a corner several years ago (which is not atypical). Now, he is aalmost always cast as an antagonist. Take ""The Equalizer"" (2014). I think he weakens an already thin plot. It would be mire interesting if someone actually betrayed him. Audiences are smart. Still, I gave it a 7/10 for the excellent stunt fighting choreography, squib work, special effects, etc. Although there are are outrageously unbelievable sniper shots made (several appear over 1 mile away) and hit dead on. I bet you $1000 the Kid who shoots Tyler at the end will have a prominent role as a ""bad guy"" in the sequel, which is already ""in the works"".",Extraction,tt8936646

399,arungeorge13,Superbly choreographed action compensates for weak storytelling! [+59%],6,25 April 2020,"Extraction offers the familiar action-movie combination of breakneck pacing, a paper-thin storyline, and dazzling set-pieces. As the title suggests, it's about a mercenary by the name of Tyler Rake (Chris Hemsworth) carrying out the extraction of a little boy (apparently, the son of a drug lord in India) from the clutches of a Bangladeshi drug lord. Aiding him covertly in his mission is a team led by Nik (Golshifteh Farahani, who's best known for About Elly). A subplot brings Saju (Randeep Hooda), the Indian drug lord's enforcer, into the scenario. What ensues is a series of ultra-violent, well-crafted (and tastefully shot by Newton Thomas Sigel) action-movie clich√©s.Hargrave chooses to cover up the fallacies in the script, some inane casting choices (Priyanshu Painyuli, for example, is a particularly bad one), the lack of locational authenticity (most of the film is shot in India, not Bangladesh except for plateshots), and disjointed Bengali lines mouthed by the gangsters, with neatly choreographed action. One such set-piece (shot like it's a single take) that gets going shortly into the 35-minute mark, is probably the best I've seen in recent memory (which is why it gets a 3 and not a 2.5). The action is punctuated by bullets whizzing past narrow alleyways, hand-to-hand combat that we've seen done better in Asian films, and a sufficient amount of blood-spilling.Heck, in what seemed like a minor nod to The Raid films, Tyler uses a rake (which is also his surname, mentioned later in a scene) to dispose of a thug. The single-shot-set-piece is straight out of the books of ""Call of Duty"", with the camera splendidly juggling between first-person and third-person action. Even for a hardcore action flick, Joe Russo writes in a few scenes that attempt to humanize the characters of Tyler and Saju. They aren't exactly acting showcases, but they get the job done. Plus, the presence of Randeep Hooda subverts the 'white savior' clich√© to a certain extent.While the scenes involving the Bangladeshi drug lord (dressed in awkward costumes) were the weakest (in terms of writing and performances), I did like how Hargrave portrayed the plight of underprivileged kids in the Indian subcontinent and how they were being used as gun-wielding henchmen. It's a template action movie alright, but there's enough machismo, explosions, and gore to please fans of the genre. It, however, needed better writing, a (much better) baddie, and more heart, to rise above its surface-level coolth.",Extraction,tt8936646

Yes, the plot is simple, but I don't necessarily see that taking away anything from the movie. With the intensity of 'Rambo', but the stylish precision of 'John Wick', this film is a perfect example of what an action movie should look like in 2020. The action sequences are simply breathtaking; each and every action sequence is wonderfully crafted and some camera angles during the fights are surprisingly awesome. There are incredible hand-to-hand combats, exciting chases and other fantasically choreographed stunts that makes this film the most exciting, and joyously violent, film of 2020. There's even some good dark humour in there too. Chris Hemsworth gives one of the best performance of his career. Not only is he incredibly physical in the role, but I actually believed the emotional side of his character; which with Hemsworth isn't usually the case. The supporting cast is also great; as is the cinematography; sound design and the excellent hair and makeup department.

Seems, it was a waste of time. But, I have had a good expectation of this movie as the maker bagged numerous good TV natoks but as a debutant he was failed. Lead actors were also new in film, but they are now realized that, there is a huge differences between TV and Film.

I came for watch this movie for only thing that it is a film by Masud Hasan Uzzal who did some brilliant work in television previous. But i rolled up! What's going on!
It was feels good to watch first 45-50 minutes as just storytelling not the making though. But times after time it feels why Uzzal made such film! Dubbing was so poor, making was so dust but there is a HOPE- Cinematography and camera movement looks rich most of the time, Editing and Coloring also gives some good vive with the cinematic movements. The storyline, making, acting, sound worst worst worst.
I really do expect more from the Director Masud Hasan Uzzal. So here's not the end it's just beginning of Masud Hasan Uzzal and his team. Hope they do better in their next film.

Plot was amazing, not exceptional but can be considered exceptional based on Bangladeshi film industry. Wonderful mix of romance,drama and a little bit of psychological at the ending. If I talk about negative sides it would be the lead actress's acting. Also the screenplay was not fabulous, may be below average.Overall it's a good movie to watch.

Going for the first film to pop up on the site,I decided to begin the final day of Borderlines viewings,by diving into the water.View on the film:Introducing the screening/stream revealing that the title was shot in monsoon seasons on a small island, writer/director Rezwan Shahriar Sumit makes his feature film debut by closely working with cinematographer Chananun Chotrungroj to make the real monsoon season a prominent element in the movie.Sumit & Chotrungroj land on the island with pelts of rain running down on hand-held tracking shots following Rudro, (played with a plucky enthusiasm by Titas Zia) bringing his artistic expressions to life in the heart of the repressive island, and gusts of wind crash onto stylish push-ins on the growing anger of the local leaders.Entering the island as an outsider, the screenplay by Sumit brilliantly sculpts Rudro's art pushing the boundaries of the hard-line religious leaders of the land into the sea,with a poetic final confrontation, where Mother Nature disproves the superstitions the locals have held about a stranger entering their land,as Sumit tastes the salt in the water.",The Salt in Our Waters,tt6955210
408,MiguelAReina,More attractive in form than in substance,6,1 February 2021,"The issue of the confrontation between the traditions of a small fishing village and a newly arrived sculptor is not original, but the film has a beautiful visual proposal, sustained in an excellent cinematography by Chananun Chotrungroj, which takes advantage of natural light and landscape. It is a film that is enjoyed in its form even though it does not contain a particularly attractive proposal.

Even if it's good enough. Music is really good. In the end, audience will witness a twist which is connected with the title of the movie. 6.5 stars for this kinda out of the box storytelling.

But I surely loved the bulk of the movie. I appreciate the tearjerker aspect and the action packed movie and the points it was making. Maybe a few jealous troll types are bored. This movie should be at the golden globes. More enjoy my review than expected so thanks so much!

491,sahil-masrur786,Watch it once for Aparajita Adhya's performance,3,8 February 2021,"The story on pen and paper might have looked good but average execution failed to do justice to the story. Its too ""telefilm-esque"". Performance wise Aparajita Adhya shines but sometimes she is too loud and Sourav does justice to his character. Madhumita Sarkar needs to work on her dialogue delivery. Whenever she goes low pitch, its hard to understand what she is saying. Also she is a bad choice for the role of Cheeni as she lacks the nuance thats needed for the character.

But there is a BIG NO ! the story is something else. There is something between the mother and daughter which you will discover in the middle of the movie.Now let's talk about the execution. The execution was decent, not too good or not too bad.In acting department the actor/actresses gave their 200% . Extremely good performances given by the lead actresses.Their was some lacking with the movie. Sometimes you will think that the director should add something more in the love relationship.

Not even one ""othu"" was pronounced.It really saddens to see the language and the pronunciation being taken so lightly by the makers of the movie. And it pains and shocks me at the same time that they could not find someone who can say the words properly!!!.Very unfortunate",Dhira,tt13449672
516,saisanapala,deserves an appreciation...,1,24 November 2020,"I started watching the movie with very low expectations, and the 1st act of the movie appeared to be just better than what I expected... But later on I got involved in it and ended up liking it... an impeccable story, with a good cinematography and good music... but this movie can be a way shorter than the one at present, with the same story... the comedy is exclusively for kids, and felt unnecessary sometimes... character animation and character design could be a lot better... back ground music is loud through out the movie... apart from these drawbacks this movie deserves a lot of appreciation and encouragement for this genre...

540,nowrozefarhan,Tour de force on a wild night in Dhaka,6,22 December 2020,"Good to see a Bangladeshi film trying to get out of traditional stereotypical plotlines and attempting a dark-comedy wrapped in a fast paced thriller, strongly promoting anti-drug message. Director Abrar Athar and all the production crews deserve applause for that.
But the film, however, looks sharp in visual, it doesn't add up much in terms of substance. The duration is merely 50 minutes. For a length of that scale, it tries too much of a story to capture. Thus, spends little time in developing the characters. We don't get too much of a detail about them. Hence sometime it gets tough to justify their actions since there's no background check. All that put aside, it does provide a positivity in terms of Cinematography. Tahsin Rahman portrays a beautiful yet sinister nightscape of Dhaka city with all it's neon lights and darkish pavements. The director too gives us multiple glimpse of Tarantino-esque dialogues and dark humors with some blends of Coen brothers. Characters breaking the fourth wall and graphic illustrations to introduce a character - all these elements give it a sort of originality. Who knows, it might even become a cult flick for BD industry.",Mainkar Chipay,tt13356580

This is one of the unique Bangla telefilms and only because it was not aired on Telly and that the solo reason they could potray the Drug related story and vulgur language.This film had everything and especially that fourth wall breaking scene, that was unexpected.

557,anikb-87099,Decent yet stretched!,7,12 May 2021,"Watched this film on TV. A decent middle class family film showcasing the struggles of an average earning man to save money for a trip to Switzerland for the happiness of his family. Quite enjoyable , some emotional moments yet it feels extremely stretched which is typical of every bengali film (for ex- if its a bengali film you have to include a Durga Pujo scene no matter how irrelevant it is to the main story and the same thing happens here in this film).

560,Dips3105,Movie is as good as the beauty of Switzerland,8,29 October 2021,"Just tell me, according to IMDB user's rating both #Switzerland and #Dictionary rates with seven star. How it could be justified? Because, both the moviea are of romance genre with different sort of story, and the story of both movies are quite fantastic and not stereotyped. One will get some freshness from both the stories. Then Abir and his realistic acting skill what he is doing for so many years are constant in both movies. Now coming to the difference, first music and in this department Switzerland is the winner without no hesitation. Music of this movie is too much effective and comes to mind with a feel. Secondly, the acting of supporting cast is also too good in Switzerland. Everybody gave their 100%. Now coming to the main difference the heroine, how the acting of Rukmini can be compared with Nusrat. Not only in this movie, at overall level, till days the skill of Rukmini ia very much superior than Nusrat. The scene where she suspects on Abir for having affair with others, in that particular scene she just killed it with her expression and showing different sort of emotions, in my words she even overshadowed Abir with her performance. So I can't give 7 üåü to Switzerland, it atleast deserves one more extra.",Switzerland,tt13335618
561,foodiejerks,Switzerland Movie Good Watch,6,13 May 2021,"In this movie, Abir has acted well along with costar Rukmini. There few loop holes which can be mitigated however you can ignore on those if you are not a critic or a critical person.Once again, movie is predictable but good watch with family.

577,MandalBros-5,LOVED It. A Heart - Warming FUN FILM.,9,1 April 2021,"First of all this is the first Anjan Dutt directed film I watched except Byomkesh's and I loved it. Every moment shines very well. A smile was always there throughout watching the film. The last twist didn't work for me BTW.No doubt BGM & songs are too good. Lyrics are fully enjoying. Entire cast is full of brilliant actors and every character is lovable. I loved Ambarish and Sritama the most.Overall it's a Heart - Warming FUN FILM.Available on Zee5 Premium.¬© MandalBros.

578,sahil-masrur786,Had potential,5,19 April 2021,"Nice story but unfortunately dragged a lot. Easily could have chopped off 15-20 mins. Also its a ""food"" movie but doesn't have much of food in it. Also Arjun's acting seemed too loud and always irritated. Sritama was refreshing to watch. Suprobhat, Ambarish and Kanchan did justice to their roles along with Annindita and Anjan Dutt in a small role. Songs are kinda absurd and cant really say I enjoyed them (except the first one by Anjan Dutt).

581,suvranilsinghachowdhury,Food was good. Music wasn't.,1,9 November 2020,"The naively choreographed dance sequences backed by absurd lyrics impedes the progress of a sincerely written screenplay. Also, why was Anindita Bose's Vania cut short? She's the only character in the film who made some sense. I wished to see more of her. She's underused. Anjan Dutt is a madman. Still Saheber Cutlet is a better watch than all other Durga Puja releases this year. Having said that, I still think there's a lot of room for improvement. Solaris, are you listening to the audience?

583,maanikroda,Watch it if you want,5,11 September 2020,"If you are still interested in the 'story', it involves Khelechi's hostile reception in the city, where he shuttles between a drug lord (Saswata Chatterjee), cops, and the team managers of Young Bengal and New Bagan (played loudly by Haradhan Bandopadhyay and Kharaj Mukherjee)-stand-ins for East Bengal and Mohun Bagan-with a little help from Raju and the rookie journalist (Ritabhari Chakraborty).The film treats the character almost like an alien. All black men apparently look the same to the people in Kolkata and this matter is played out for laughs. This could have been material for zany black comedy, if not the sincere, sensitive humaneness of Sudani from Nigeria, the Malayalam film about an African footballer in Kerala. But the film doesn't wholeheartedly embrace a commercial style either, unlike say, how a Raj Chakraborty is sometimes able to. Tiki Taka has pretensions. It wants to use a famous Baul song reprised by Arijit Singh and flaunt the city's legendary footballing rivalries without really getting the spirit of either right. It's all gimmicky superficial Bangaliana, emblematic of an industry that has become too comfortable with mediocrity.The film's tone-deafness is shocking as it is. The comedian, Kanchan, plays a small time goon who introduces Khelechi to his boss by using a Bengali phrase that puns on the word kalo (Bengali for black). What the film thinks is casual, harmless fun is casual racism, and not fun. One character mishears his surname as Ajgubi (meaning strange). It's supposed to be hilarious. I don't know. 2020 is the worst year.",Tiki Taka,tt12986942

The way of presenting a life of an aspiring filmmaker is truly inspiring and his courage to win over the challenges surrounded is truly recommendable.
Directed by Amritangshu Chakravarty, this is surely a soulful journey of a filmmaker whose inspiring tale will be etched to heart.Barun Chanda plays one of the most prominent characters in the film Choroibeti.And rest of the pivotal characters are portrayed wonderfully by newcomers.You really shouldn't miss this encouraging expedition.

The Director with Cinematographer/DOP has Justified each scene with precise manner and proper timing of shots due to which some emblematic aspects of the movie emerge and reach to the Audiences.
->A movie is about a sweet strong belief and imagination of a child who do not speak the words clearly but not dumb.
One day child GAUR , the central character of the movie, with her two elder sisters enjoys the pithe(Rice Cake) served by his mother. One of the Pithas (Rice cakes) , he plants/sows in earth with hope that one day it will grow big and transformed in to tree which is his an imagination & strong belief. He also hears and confirms his imagination from his Grandma's that in ""KASHI "", there are so many trees of DOODH PITHER GACCH (Rice cakes) where she is going and he rushes in to the train from the village to that city in search of the said trees to satisfy his imagination.......
-> In my opinion, this film has a poetic effect about imagination with spiritual essence of a seven years old child which each and Every child imagines in their childhood.
-> Every director wants to say something thru his movie. Thru this movie, Director Ujjwal Basu reaches to the people and wants to say that a living style of the people in villages are still simple which separate the villages from the city's crowd where kids dream to fulfil their incredible imagination in free environment.
-> Fascinated by this cinema, the audiences of Urban /City people may feel and enjoy the cool and simplicity of village with poetic and cinematic effects of the movie.
-> Cinematography, Editing, Music, mise in scene, some eye candy camera moves have made this movie remarkable.
-> Acting part of this movie is Natural.
-> Overall, this is the fittest movie to witness and enjoy.
ABOVE all this movie is an effort of the Villagers who are also a part of this movie.
Congratulations to the team and Especially to Director and DOP of this movie..",Doodhpither Gachh,tt12712346
656,msunando,The exasperating story of a detective who is out hunting for a mystery,2,18 August 2020,"The opening sequence of Detective should have been sign enough about the film's objective. Detective, the director's objective notwithstanding, is nothing more than a spoof, failing to inspire any excitement, thrill, suspense or even an iota of expectation. The worst part about the film is that the characters neither inspire nor help the viewer to associate with them. It's based on the eponymous short story by Rabindranath Tagore, but the script and narrative have been altered to suit the cinematic requirements.Mahimchandra (Anirban Bhattacharya) is a detective who dreams about cases that present challenge and excitement in his professional life, as he normally gets to deal with petty criminals who own up to their crimes the moment they are arrested. His assistant Hutashon (Ambarish Mukherjee), who is referred to as Watson, alluding to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's legendary creation of Sherlock Holmes, is a more grounded individual who realizes that the humdrum and petty cases are what they are cut out for. Mahim's wife Sudha (Ishaa Saha) suffers from romantic neglect from her husband, and has had connections with the independence revolutionaries in her past. Mahim one day discovers that a young man named Manmatha (Shaheb Bhattacharya) has been loitering around the former's home and sets out to uncover the truth behind his interests. Mahim sets up a covert operation where he befriends Manmatha and rents a place in the same hostel where the latter lives to investigate his real intentions. Little does he know that Manmatha was Sudha's beau and belonged to the same group that challenges anyone that states his or her allegiance with the ruling British.That's Kabiguru's ""Detective"" in reality, but what you get here is some uninspiring performances lacking conviction, a script that drags and meanders its way so much that you don't really care what the outcome is and a finale that still leaves you stunned with its inane and amateur treatment. Detective fails to engage right from the beginning as we fail to understand if we should take the film seriously or is it finally a comedy that we have to warm up to. It is excruciatingly slow, eliciting prayer after prayer for it to end, and if not, at least start getting slightly interesting. The climax is exasperating but hugely relieving that the ordeal is finally over. Avoid watching ""Detective"" at all costs, read up the original short story instead.",Detective,tt12676972

This was ridiculously slow with nothing really going on. Saheb chaterjee was terribly terribly miscast with his modern haircut, clothing and general body language. I failed to understand the point of most of the characters. One performance i truly enjoyed was that of the girl enlisted by the detective to extract information from Mahim. She was a delight. The dress design, the haircuts were not true to the era at all, no attention was paid to the details. Awful waste of time.

664,obhisek-38365,Pleasure to watch,9,27 May 2021,"I am shocked to see the rating for this. It was a wonderful story by Rabindranath himself, which was so before time. We have seen many comedy-suspense stories or movies recently but in that time it was a revolutionary idea. The movie did a justice to the story with apt acting by Anirban and Isha. Ending was also not predictable. I think the users who gave this a low rating aren't aware of the comdey-suspense genre. I think it should be 8 star but gave 9 to balance out (if any). Overall a very enjoyable movie.

Shaheb and Ishaa were good as well. The story was more or less well adapted except for some of the comic reliefs which were cringeworthy. The overuse of background music and sound effects were irritating at times. Not a good film but watchable.

669,vikonian,Why Anierban Why?,1,21 August 2020,"An unengaging and plain bad movie. You get an idiot for a detective who is the protagonist. This is neither a detective mystery thriller nor a comedy and goes nowhere. Almost two hours runtime feels like two days. They were confused whether to show the 'Swadeshi' revolutionaries in good or bad light. There's no resolution to why Mahimchandra is not attracted to his wife. I'm sure Rabindranath didn't write this crap. It failed to create the atmosphere of the 1900s. It fees like an episode from a Star Jalsa period drama. Surprisingly, Anirban's acting also falls below his standard. I wonder, why he signed up for this trash. Worst movie of the year.

672,anikb-87099,Make something new!,3,5 October 2021,"By this time, we have witnessed N number of such films with exactly the same story and screenplay and SOS Kolkata is no different. That same story of terrorists barking out the age old ""Jannat naseeb hoga"" dialogues, same old attack like I have seen a million times like in 26/11 films and documentaries and that same one hero story film.On top of that, the acting is bad especially by the sides and Nusrat doesnt fit that role of an ATS officer speaking in a weird stylish way desperately trying to look cool and bold. And Yash! Well his one expression face doesnt help a lot and his dialogue delivery too is unconvincing. Mimi is wasted.When its a bengali commercial action, you know logic might just be hit for a six and SOS Kolkata is one of its kind. Who the hell takes their wife on a mission to kill terrorists in a jungle? Just bcz she is with you at that time so you have to take her? No sense at all. 5 terrorists together firing at 4 ATS units at a stairway with no cover whatsover and none of from both sides get hurt or anything! Unbelievable!Mid way through the film when i realized it is gonna be nothing different from those regular terrorist attack films, i stopped watching. The next day, i skipped some parts and tried to see if there is something different but no! It was all the same. If you are making films like this, try making it in a new way/approach instead of using the same ingredients that many have used till now.",SOS Kolkata,tt12655954

Especially Thakurmar Jhuli can be called a gem. However, the ghosts of their own culture have survived until now in other countries in the world. But in our culture, these ghosts are out of date now. The name of such an outdated ghost is Brahmadaitya. A web movie has recently been created based on this ghost.Maybe Hoichoi platform producing in a lot of experimental works. Tasher Ghar and this movie is proof of that. It was very interesting for me, to brings those folklore ghosts or demons into the modern age. But looking at the story and the screenplay, it seems - a small child was playing with adult toys.I was not scared to see the Brahmaditya ghost; but I was scared to see Sayantani's performance. Horrible acting. And did Rudronil really need to act like that? Disappointed. Continuity was so broken that I lost my temper. Such as when the iron trunk is burnt in the fire, it becomes wood!

This one is even better than the last one. A surprise mix of horror and Bengali folktales, with a strong dose of humor thrown in. While the performances are loud and over the top and the make up of the ghost, a bit tacky, the story telling and the back ground score make this an engaging watch. Also, the sheer quirkiness of the plot and funny one liners make this a consistently entertaining watch.

It has poor CGI, cheap ass production value and inadequate horror FX make up. Yet, it is a thoroughly entertaining watch and has it's heart in the right place. Having grown up hearing scary tales of Brombhodoityo and other supernatural legends of Bengal from my grandparents, I could relate strongly with this film. The director's intention to revamp old, forgotten legends has been clearly stated through the dialogues of a character, and this must be applauded. The story is innovative and unlike any Indian horror film I have ever seen. I hope more such films get made.

However, recently I saw it enlisted among the best Bengali films of 2020 by many critics. So, I thought I should give it a shot and went in with zero expectations. I must say I loved it. However, it is not a film for everyone. Hardcore horror fans might not like the comedy bits, especially towards the end of the film. I understand this is one the biggest aspects which has led to some bad feedback about the movie. However, I personally loved the blend of horror and comedy and the light hearted ending with a strong moral message worked well for me. Do watch.

698,Suvodip88,First of its kind ! Unique folk horror !,9,3 October 2020,"I honestly had zero expectations from this movie. Had no idea it even existed as there were zero visible promotions before release. The film completely took me by surprise. It was funny, yet creepy. Though most of the jump scares were cliched and the horror scenes are loud, some of the creepy moments are really good, which is rare for a Bengali film. The amalgamation of folk tales and mythology with horror is interesting and I couldn't help but feel nostalgic. The film has a quirky black humor throughout that keeps things entertaining. However, the execution of a couple of scenes towards the end of the film is rather amateurish. Yet, the film redeems itself with a satisfying and fiery climax, followed by a rather funny and intriguing last scene. Hope to see more such folk horror films based on supernatural legends of Bengal.

701,zubaerullash,Uber disappointment,3,18 September 2020,"Spoiler alert.
The attempt was nice, but there are so many flaws.
Though the director was able enough to pulvarize the whole thing, however the protagonist also joined him along with her awkward acting skills & all. I mean she may suitable for typical sensual acting, romantic role. But for a horror movie?! A big no,.no!There are so many loose ends, no continuity.
Props were cheap and poorly arranged. That nose ring, metal teeth from james bond movie, that trunk( metal/wood?)
That fatso cop with unconventional hair. The way the protagonist continuously asking for money like a gold digger. Just awful.They literally messed with everything..
If you don't have the ability then plz do not ruin these precious genre, or else viewers will loose their interest.

702,msunando,"Life is a multi layered, continuous journey and not all relationships we develop are tied by blood",8,4 July 2020,"Biplab Sen (Prasenjit) and his much younger, new colleague Bhaskar (Satyam Bhattacharya) are on a trip to the high mountains to finalize a plot for a hotel project on behalf of their company. They are like chalk a cheese, Sen is mature, confident and in control of the situation, while Bhaskar is edgy, restless and impatient. In many days and nights they spend together on the trip, their relationship starts with contempt towards each other, but slowly warms up with each confessing to his own share of problems and explaining the philosophy of life. We are given to understand that Sen takes such trips to temporarily run away from his manic depressive wife, and Bhaskar has taken this trip to bolster the courage to introduce his wife from the north-eastern states to his super conservative family.On the eve of their departure back to Kolkata, tragedy strikes. Young Bhaskar succumbs to a cardiac arrest and dies, leaving Sen distraught and unsettled. Whilst Sen does the needful to fly down the dead body of his colleague back to Kolkata, he avoids meeting Bhaskar's family and returns home. Sen bottles up his feelings inside, takes leave from his office and stays home with his unstable wife, and shares no details with her, until one day he discovers that Bhaskar's wife had given birth to a baby girl and was accepted into the latter's family. He realizes why Bhaskar hadn't mentioned about the fact that his wife was so close to childbirth and decides to go and meet Bhaskar's family, thus confronting his demons.Nirontor is an arthouse production by Prasenjit himself, directed by Chandrasish Ray. It's slow, languid pace and brevity of the story balance the depth of human emotions, relationships and reactions to situations that arise in the film. Prasenjit is mellow and sensitive in his portrayal of Biplab Sen, a man who has had to deal with his wife's disintegration due to the inability to conceive. He uses the project tours as an opportunity to escape from a suffocating marriage, but attempts to rebuild the bridge with his wife after the tragedy reveals to him that whilst individuals may perish, life continues through others connected to them and must be lived responsibly. Satyam Bhattacharya makes a sound impact. Anita Majhi as the depressive wife battling her condition as well as the growing distance with her husband is sensitive too.",Nirontor,tt12527188
703,suprabhattacharya,A narrative brilliance,9,31 July 2020,"The meaning of the Bengali word Nirontor is continuous i.e without interruption like human life. The film dives into a conversational journey about life, death, communication, love and responsibility throughout its running time.The story of the film although well written is merely an envelope to the narrative of this film. The narrative structure of the film builds up mainly on silence, blank frames which reminds me of Ceylan and Angelopoulos's narratives.
The film mainly revolves around three characters of Bhaskar,Biplob and Jonaki played respectively by Satyam Bhattacharya, Prosenjit Chattopadhay and Ankita Majhi. The contrast in their characters and perspective towards life works beautifully to enhance the brilliance in storytelling.
Prosenjit Chatterjee delivers a performance which really matches the minimalistic approach of the film. Satyam Bhattacharya in contrast to the character of Prosenjit has given a effortless performance and really fits into his character.Ankita Majhi has played a role of an woman with acute depression with maturity, inhibiting the role completely. The film explores serious issues in a subtle away i.e not being overdramatic and preachy. The characters make you realize that all of them have regrets, tears to hide but they are silently strolling around in their life despite this. No one cries or shouts in this film but you will equally feel their tear and anger even when they are silent.
Chrandasis Roy has done wonders in his debut directiorial venture .Soumik Halder's brilliant camerawork captures every details and frames and makes you feel the immersive silence in the film. The film is definitely not a joywatch but surely it is surely a rich cinematic experience.",Nirontor,tt12527188

706,arkachattopadhyay,A brooding film on two conversational journeys on birth and death,8,27 July 2020,"A brooding film on two conversational journeys on birth and death that have their own scores to settle with longing, loneliness, depression and missed encounters. The cinematography is spot on; so are the performances. The seemingly inconsequential and recurrent scene with characters that do not and yet do feature in the storyline lingers at the end. In the field of cinematic vision which was marked earlier by the protagonist's eyes, we see a young couple, out for evening walk, planning a quick trip to the hills before the summer arrives. Going back and forth with shadows first preceding and then following them, they deftly touch the outer lining of the story we have seen unfold throughout the film from the inside. Nirontor can be watched on ZEE5.

She lives with her grandmother, having lost her parents early in a car accident, and aspires to be a radio presenter and lead a normal life, but her doctor urges caution. He advises her to take yoga classes repeatedly, until she signs up one day. Here she meets Shammo (Chandan Roy Sanyal) and it doesn't take her long to fall in love with him, but he is hesitant. She soon realizes that Shammo is already married and his wife Kheya is wheelchair bound. Kheya has also learnt about Swarnaja and befriends her in a unique twist of events and the two women develop a strong friendship. One day though, Kheya attempts suicide, leaving Swarnaja distraught and the latter understands that her friend's act was because of her inability to conceive a child.Swarnaja offers to become a surrogate mother, much against her doctor's warnings and her grandmother's wishes, but she has made up her mind. Upon delivering the child however, Shammo and Kheya simply vanish from Swarnaja's life, plunging her into depths of depression. A few years go by and again by a twist of fate, Swarnaja's path will cross with Shammo, Kheya and her child, who incidentally has genetically inherited the golden blood. But this time, Swarnaja's resolve, tenacity, investigative skills and resilience are about to be tested, if the ties of blood have to be protected.""Rawkto Rawhoshyo"" is a social drama and thriller with a unique plot. The director Soukarya Gnosal revels in quite a few twists and suspense, making the film a good combination of emotions at play and a crime thriller playing out in the backdrop. Koel Mallick is par excellence as the surrogate, single mother deprived of the love and respect she deserved for the gift of surrogacy for her friend. She also shines in the latter part of the film as the crime investigation gets into full swing. But comparatively, Chandan Roy Sanyal and Basabdatta Chatterjee's roles are poorly etched, underdeveloped and weakly executed. The motive behind the crime is predictable. Rwitobroto Mukherjee delivers a punchy performance as a young boy who understands Swarnaja's pain. But the weakest point of the film is that the friendship between Swarnaja and Kheya hasn't been defined strongly enough (it's a matter of a few weeks) to warrant the former to decide on surrogacy when the latter attempts suicide. It just didn't come across as a convincing action, backed by a credible justification for the decision.",Rawkto Rawhoshyo,tt12339374

That is the time you have to recheck your rationale to see if it has switched off by narcotics. Under its influence you can enjoy the goof.

I usually watch movies in English language for entertainment. This Bengali movie is one of the few Bengali movies I have watched just for curiosity.Even though these type of movies are taken into genres such as drama and mystery, they are very different than the Satyajit Ray and Sandip Ray's ""Feluda"" movies. These type of movies are also different than the modern detective/ thriller movies or, TV series based on books. A new genre should be made for these ""realistic"" mystery/ thriller movies based on ""unique"" story/ screenplay. Where the mystery or twist in the story gets the significance it deserves and the story is told effortlessly while holding the modern demands and essence of great cinematography.This movie is exceptionally good in storytelling and screenplay. The essential part of the plot is very good and quite innovative in the sense of being aligned with real criminal records and modern world events. The acting of a very few of actors has made this movie very believable and enjoyable. The songs are compatible enough with the screenplay and two of them are heart-warming. Some dialogues, parts of the screenplay and direction for actions are very good.Some parts of the plot, cinematography and details in a scene are felt unnecessary and spoiled the scene along with that part of the plot.

716,SoumikBanerjee25,Close to being perfect!,8,12 December 2020,"""Dracula Sir"" is a drama with an ingrained psychological aspect. Dealing with an anguished yet innocent mind; the storyline delves deeper in its empirical topic. Heightened up by stellar acts & music; the aftermath lefts a lasting impression.
Bengali films have come a long way, from a myriad of caricaturist melodramas to a wide array spectrum of engrossing concepts.
An irrefutable alteration decisively changed the perception of whole industry as well as the mindset of its viewers.Debaloy Bhattacharya as the director, managed to conserve gloomy undertones with infrequent gore elements. With the requisite help of staggering compositions & downright excellence in cinematography; he was able to indite a story based around a psychological viewpoint with political insinuations. Nevertheless a thought provoking depiction of a loner's perspective in this unkind world.Performances are commendable with Anirban as Raktim/Amol stealing every frame he featured in.
Mimi Chakraborty as Monjari played her role admirably with an enduring calmness. Others, unfortunately didn't have much else to do.
As per the writing goes, the first half seemed comparatively better. The plot gets rather convoluted in the second half and couldn't really make a proper recovery.The concept, the way it's been presented; I perceived a strong temptation, an arcane connection that couldn't be expressed through words. It can only be felt!",Dracula Sir,tt11963736
717,msunando,"An artful take on Count Dracula in modern times, imaginative and heart-rending",8,30 January 2021,"Raktim (Anirban Bhattacharya) has protruding canines teeth that makes him a butt of jokes. Shunned by the society and friendless, Raktim leads an almost aimless life in isolation, only going to the school where he is a temporary Bengali subject teacher, facing ridicule from his colleagues and students alike. He would prefer to be invisible, but that's impossible. Above all this, he is haunted and disturbed by his vivid recollection of his previous birth when he was Amal Shome, a naxal activist who had to seek refuge in a dark terrace room of the house where Manjari (Mimi Chakraborty), his lost love, and a young widow lived alone. Raktim's awareness of his previous birth and his tragic death in a police encounter and his current ignominy are a potent concoction that he is unable to handle.A chance incident at a film shoot that he is forced to attend brings out his thirst for blood, bringing alive his likeness to Count Dracula, but involuntarily so. Another similar incident at his rented abode leads to the death of his landlord, throwing his life into total disarray. He is now labelled a schizophrenic and mentally disturbed as Raktim has now transformed into Amal Shome, and law must bring matters under control by curing Raktim's psychological disorder, or is that really it?Dracula Sir is a masterpiece by Debaloy Bhattacharya and Anirban Bhattacharya is in ace form. So immensely credible and powerful is his performance that one cannot remain indifferent to his towering presence. He is in every frame of the film, but each one is creatively and artistically presented that has managed to overcome the somewhat languid pace of the storytelling. On the other hand one may argue that the running time of 125 minutes is certainly worth its weight in gold as it showcases talent of a different genre. Mimi has a shorter but powerful role as well, giving it a mellow, dignified yet sensuous touch to the character of Manjari, Amal's muse. The music to Dracula Sir is perhaps the cherry topping, listen to ""Shubhoratri Priyotama"", ""Raat Pohale"" and ""Abar Jonmo Nebo"" and marvel at the soul stirring lyrics and melody. Do watch Dracula Sir if you've still not caught it on Hoichoi, it's one of the best films of of the recent years.",Dracula Sir,tt11963736

720,i_lalindra,Class act by Anirban,8,19 June 2021,"What an actor. Anirban bhattacharya at his best. If you are looking for the best acting performance movie well this is it.Music and art direction also unique and bring the audience to the different level which was well suit to the climate of the film.There is bit of concept from hollywood movie ""Joker"" at the beginning but finally it is settle down on different platform. More than a thriller i would love to called it as a classic drama which is very rare in industry.We can hope more from Anirban in future for sure.

726,Thechocolateboy,Tired Drama with Naxalite Luring,4,11 December 2020,"Just finished the hyped movie by Debaloy, but to be honest, only to find it overhyped for no reason.The story unfolds Raktim( Anirban) , a part time bengali teacher of a Govt High school having two unusually large canines - inducing insecurities among the people around him. On the parallel runs a story of '71s where Amal( Anirban) is a Naxalite , choosing rebellion before his beloved one played by Mimi. Later the movie feeds us a 'twist' where 'things are not as it seems' ; but could Debaloy merge it well with the storyline ? NO for me.Direction is quite mediocre showcasing only Anirban on 90% of the frames. Acting-wise it's definitely not his best but reasonable. The tired scenes about '71s are overused in most of the books and earlier movies; hence nothing to shock. The BGM and songs are a big thumbs up, though they make the movie only more melodramatic. The storyline had promise, but not executed properly.This movie is like a dress stiched up combining various colorful pieces of clothes- making the dress clownish. My recommendation is 15Park Avenue instead.",Dracula Sir,tt11963736

Ending is not at all expecting no matter how hard someone tries to guess.

I found out that the movie consists of many inspirations drawn from other international movies but didn't copy any of them . The Storyline was genuine and so was the storytelling and unraveling the fact that not two but three stories are told in parallel and in the conclusion we find no conclusion at all . Outstanding character acting by Anirban . Also , the movie greatly protests against ""Indian Fascists"" in the form of a satire where the facists are portrayed as a form of the villain characters. Most of the audience were uncultured though because they were making out in the movie theater which was gross because the movie was great . Mimi was finally back to her roots which was a surprise because currently she has joined the fascist government . Overall I'd say that we don't deserve such a good movie .

As an audience it was a bit difficult to relate these two parallel stories! However, the acting, cinematography and the music keep me in the seat to watch the full movie. The director revealed the story twist but the end scene is not clear or convince me.
The strength of this film is the acting of Mr Anirban, Ms Mimi and Mr Rudranil and the music along with the excellent cinematography! I just love this. Ny the way, the scripting was also good. The screenplay may not score A+ but it's still the best work of Mr Debaloy.

771,SoumikBanerjee25,Had the potential to go further!,6,29 September 2020,"""Asur"" exhibits an Artist's wicked mind and prevalent stubbornness for his creations. Along the path, neatly capturing the essence of Bengalis' beloved ""Durga Puja"" which leads us to an inadequate cessation.Bengali films have come a long way.
A new era has brought countless talented individuals to this ever growing industry.
Being a Bengali myself, I'm proud of what they try to pursue in this venerable craft!Asur proves that!Made with sheer admiration for our culture, pulling deep strings within our practices, this sheds a light on our community for the global audience; who are unfamiliar with the traditions we highly possess.
The camera work was key to that.
Several scenic shots with some experimental ones as well; Pavel, the director has made sure to give his work of art a versatile treatment! With a comparatively grandeur scale, visuals are a treat indeed.
Alongside with a melodious soundtrack that appeases your mind. Fitting so well with the ambience. A noteworthy core group of performances kept an otherwise slower screenplay up. Speciai mention must go to Abir & Jeet, both of them uphold their roles respectively.Even with an abundance of positives, there are few flagrant errors. The usual cringe in the dialogues, at times bit too much corny for my taste! Pacing is inconsistent with huge dips in between. The relationships & the bond shown between our three leads left a large room for improvisation.
In conclusion, keeping aside these hindrances, it's a passionately made movie which defines our thousand years of culture. Albeit with the hidden potential, it should have gone further in terms of the narration.",Asur,tt11497480
772,ayonbhunia,Asur,5,26 September 2021,"This movie is worth a watch ! I am not a petdon who watches bengali movies tho i want to watch this and this has done excellent job ! The movie shows that the value of art and how people often don't recognize it !

The first Bengali film of this decade is a masterpiece. I am pretty sure this will be a CULT. ABIR & NUSRAT also were brilliant. Hats off. üëå

778,Dips3105,Asur can be watched once due to its storytelling.,7,20 April 2020,"The movie is worthy to be watched especially in this era of Bengali cinema where 80 to 90 percentage movies are the remake of South. The story is quite unique with a different kind of aspects of romance. A bit of thrilling moment is also there before the climax which makes the movie more exciting. Both Abir and Jeet have done some quiet fabulous acting. But specially Abir, he is outstanding on his job as much as he have done in any Byomkesh or Sona Da movie. He is just exceptional and does justice with his role. I just want to ask Jeet why he
is wasting his talent by doing the commercial larger than life movies. I think he doesn't know what he could be capable of. But only the minus point in the movie is Nusrat. She got a good character to showcase her talent but could not justify with her acting. She just faded away between the two male leads. I was expecting something more from her. The music is also good.
So overall the movie is worth to watch once.

783,arijhinku,An offbeat Bengali commercial movie,8,11 June 2020,"A fitting tribute to the famous sculptor Sir Ramkinkar Baij. This movie is a relationship drama in the backdrop of the largest Durga idol of Deshbandhu park. The movie is a wonder to behold. Director Pavel builds the story carefully and intricately just to give an ending none expected. This is one of those movies which should have boasted of huge box office numbers, unfortunately it didn't happen due to the lack of audience who passionately watch Bangla Cinema. The movie has slight mistakes and loopholes but the tight screenplay and world class performances keep you engaged through out the film. This movie is a milestone in Bengali commercial cinema.

The script(though it has some flaws) keeps you engaged through out the movie.This movie is an epitome of bengali art and culture. And acting wise saying, Jeet has rediscovered himself as an actor, He reminds us about the mad artist Ramkinkar Baij, this is his best work till date, people who say he can't act should go and watch the film,And Nusrat too has given a stellar performance,and Aabir acting as a pro, not unusual for him! There were competition among these 3 that who will overshadow whom(acting wise)! And last but not the least the 'Background music', boy its just amazing, Bickram Ghosh has done an excellent job! The last seen with that BGM gave goosebumps really.

I used to wonder that being one of the best actors in India, why Jeet does not come out from the traditional entertainment zone type of movies and create something big. Finally, this is big. This movie is engaging and at the same time its thought provoking. There are very few movies in Bengali which are made this big. All the actors did their job wonderfully... story line, direction, music, everything was superb. I rate it 8 out of 10 because I think there could be more focus on the character of Kigan (Jeet), in other words, it seemed to me that I wanted to know more about Kigan, wanted to know more aspects of his nature.

Somebody in a group mentioned it as a hybrid of ""Cinemawala"" (indica) and ""Basu Poribar"" (sativa), I can see why. Avik Mukhopadhyay could not save the movie with his beautiful efforts through lens. Even it was painful to see how the smart scene cutting choices taken by Arghyakamal Mitra was not used properly. One of the very few films to show all the seasons of a year in similarly boring way and now, even ""Meghnad Badh Rahasya"" seems cooler.

798,suprabhattacharya,Soumitra is still here,8,5 March 2020,"Bonkubabur Bondhu is inspired from Romapodo Chowdhury's Chaad and the screenplay is penned by Utsav Mukherjee and Dutta himself.Anik Dutta to me is the most relevant director working in Tollywood.The trademarks of a typical Anik Dutta films are here,an ensemble cast with their own peculiarities sharing fair amount of screentimes too,the magic of storytelling introduces all the characters of the film in just first thirty minutes .We get to have a glimpse on every character in that short span of time, now the story moves to the upcoming events regarding the man in lead Soumitra Chatterjee(Borunbabu).
Borunbabu is an excessively idealistic man which sometimes affects his children and relatives ,neither he uses his influence (which he is said to have)to help anyone nor he uses the same for himself.He has a wooden perspective of the world but also enjoys a friendly relation with his grandson.He doesn't hesitate to be brutally honest about anything,his view of the world is like an essay writer rather than a poet.He doesn't expect his sons and daughters to be his old age life insurance ,not because they are opportunistic and insensitive but because he wants to live independently not relying on anyone's shoulders.These certain traits of his character has alienated him from his other family members living in the same house.
Everything changes when the newly appointed president of India who also happens to be his school friend decides to pay him a visit.The film is predictable from the very moment the news was heard.The film in order to immoratlise and make the character of Soumitra more idealistic make the rest of the characters as mere opportunists and vultures ready for the plunder.The film falls in the same area which I don't expect it to fall i.e generalizing the characters.
Dutta has intricately woven the borunbabu character with accuracy and precision ,and no one but Soumitra Chatterjee could play this role.He literally embraces the character with ease,effortless and enigmatic ,Soumitra Chatterjee is the lifeline of the film .On the contrast,Sukumar Babu 's(one of the very few friends of Borunbabu) character played by Paran Bandhopadhay is completely different -optimistic and hopeful,Soumitra and Paran shared an enjoyable chemistry .The other performances are good.Rittick Chakroborty has specially impressed whenever given chance,the cast has been loyal to the roles.The film also tactfully displayed the political inclinations of Anik Dutta in the most subtle way.The film tagged as ""Anik Dutta er onno chobi"" lacks the visual appeal of his previous works.The film tries to deliver a delivered message in the most ordinary way and doesn't count as a benchmark for the director.The film is no doubt a watchable film and nevertheless a good one too ,anyone can just watch it for Soumitra's gigantic performance .",Borunbabur Bondhu,tt11497378

In today's world, this type of characters is rare, but I hope they are still present. Otherwise, our society will not survive.

802,dasguptahirak,Dreams are like those tiny stars that you get to see even on a cloudy night sky,1,28 June 2021,"When those like Bachchu Mondal - the innocent car mechanic from Urojahaj - look at the dark sky, they search for those tiny dots of hope. Bachchu is like the optimists who believe in Paolo Coelho's oft-quoted line stating that ""when you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it"". But does that really happen for poor dreamers of today whose fantasies are either ridiculed or astutely misinterpreted as bizarre conspiracies?One of the best movie which will force you to enter into the magical world of Sir Buddhadev Dasgupta.....

810,debojitnandi211,A direct slap on some of the jinx of our society.,1,26 July 2020,"Brahma Janen Gopon Kommoti - story inspired by Smt. Nandini Bhowmik's life, is an absolute pick for Women's Day. Stared by my personal favourite Ritabhari Chakraborty ran her own show with the support of Soham Majumdar portrayed a perfect husband-wife (name of Bikramaditya and Sarbari aka Panchali) in an imperfect society.This movie was a direct slap on some of the jinx of our society. And I can't afford to miss it's points:
1. Cast System - Brahmin cannot marry a lower cast.
2. Women Enlightenment - Only a Brahmin Man is allowed to be a priest.
3. Periods - A women can't enter in temples or worship Gods when she is in her periods.
4. NO Kanyadaan - A girl is not a thing or money that can be donated as ""Daan"". Like a boy a girl also choose her mate with equal rights.And it ended with two good messages:
1. A woman can do anything if she is determined.
2. In life you will find so many good and bad things happening around you. You should always consider those good things to grow up and ignore the bad parts and move on.",Brahma Janen Gopon Kommoti,tt11318348
811,babishops,An honest attempt with some cliched approach,7,14 February 2021,"The movie has its heart in its right place. It is a honest attempt to portray some serious regular issues like women empowerment plus gender inequality. Rithabhari did a fine job but some how I had a feeling while pronouncing the puja sloks or verse, she might have gone way too much conscious which effected her screen portrayal.Soham Majumder of Kabir Singh fame as the husband of the protagonist did a decent job. The movie could have been much better if only the pre climax or the climax didnt had that amount of cliche melodramatic attempt.
In short : Decent One time watch.

Poor & abrupt editing, pathetic camera work , pathetic screen play & worst dialogue writing . Above all , pathetic acting . Director Aritra Mukherjee had no idea how to extract acting from the actors. I feel petty for talented Soham Majumdar & Subhashis Mukherjee. Ritabhari Chakraborty , Manashi Sinha , Soma Chatterjee are pathetic in acting . 95% of the film based on close shots & unnecessary branding. A perfect daily soap.Not a great debut for Aritra Mukherjee as an Director. Film making is not everyone's cup of tea.

First of all hats off to Pratim D. Gupta for the whole concept of this movie. Secondly ofcourse his unique style of describing the narrative which is really really awesome may it be Ahare Mon, Saheb Bibi Ar Golam, Mach Mishti & More or this movie. Thirdly, the performances were exceptional playing four different characters in one single frame is matter of real headache but this duo Arjun and Madhumita did an appreciable job. The ensemble cast too was good but the show stealler was Paoli Dam in grey shade. I personally loved this new genre of Bangla Cinema and would highly highly recommend it, do give it a watch not for me but for this much much underrated director Pratim D. Gupta.

No logical explanation rather showing that hypnosis is too simple made this movie a joke. It was forcefully proven to be a romantic movie. They forget everything everyday but they fall in love each day. This logic seems so unrealistic and moreover, every time love was pictured as a cheap feeling that come so easily. I think the story writer of this movie had only time pass type relationship in his life. Therefore, his attitude towards love is so bogus. The overall set up was for a producing a tv show which is so much popular but recorded with hidden cameras.

831,SoumikBanerjee25,Destroyed the essence of the whole storyline!,3,15 May 2020,"After 22e Srabon, I was anticipating a deserving sequel. I was so eager to see what Srijit Mukherjee does with the plot this time. But the only thing I got is utter disappointment. The execution here is so bad on so many levels.The Cinematography, the Tonality of the film is nice, it sets up a pretty good vibe accordingly. The sound score has become repetitive at times. Especially whenever Anirban's Character shows up, the same sound has been used. Now I get it that was the theme track for his character. But what was the actual need for over excessive usage of the same tones over and over again?The performances are just good. Nothing extraordinary except Anirban Bhattacharya. He is so versatile and can do different roles with ease. I hope he continues in same fashion. Parambrata was good generally but there were certain scenes where I felt him to be overreactive and over the top dramatic. That really did bother me. For such a renowned actor I don't expect such loose ends.Now let's talk about the story and the ever debated 'Twist'. Well some might have liked it, some disliked. For me? Personally I would have love to keep it as an open ending. Rather than just giving all the explanations right away without much substance and clarity! Before the climax, the story feels dragged on so many occasions. Thanks to Some unnecessarily stretched scenes/conversations. And a relationship struggle, that never really settled on a conclusion nor did it give any essential input into the storyline. It was just there for the sake of pleasing the "" Specific Fanbase"".When the twist hits, it certainly seemed clever and I was shocked at it too. At first it baffled me and more I started to think; the more it became illogical and dumb to be honest. As this is a direct sequel to '22e Srabon' many statements given towards the end made no sense at all. The explanations themselves sounded contrary to what we have already known from the previous instalment! It literally made no sense.Overall I disliked the movie. As a thriller it was supposed to be fast paced and enthralling but instead we get a slow burner that never really left Its mark and in the end turned out to be a confusing dilemma.",Dwitiyo Purush,tt10778840
832,msunando,"Brilliant story and suspense, somewhat marred by patchy direction and editing",7,30 March 2020,"Dwitiyo Purush - A juvenile criminal Khoka aspires to reign among the notorious in the underbelly of Chinatown in Kolkata. He and his gang of goons believe in graphic violence and will stop at nothing. Khoka commits three murders in his signature style, of a rival gang leader, a police informant and a fearless police officer, before being intelligently trapped and arrested by Kolkata Police.Cut to 25 years since then. Khoka (Anirban Bhattacharya) returns to Chinatown after serving his jail sentence to rebuild his empire all over again, and begins by committing murders in the same pattern. So is he a serial killer and what's his motive for the repetition? Abhijit Pakrashi (Parambrata) is the investigating officer who is still haunted by the nightmares from the poet murderer case (flashback to Srijit Mukherjee's epic 22she Sraban), who starts putting the jigsaw of clues together. He also has a battle on the homefront where his marriage is on the rocks! What score does Khoka have to settle with Abhijit?It's a brilliant story written by veteran Mani Shankar Mukherjee (Chowringhee, Seemabaddha.....) that holds up the suspense until the very last frame and you cannot not marvel at the mystery with the case. The execution is somewhat patchy, especially the editing and the super graphic violence with the murders which could well have been avoided. Director Srijit Mukherjee connects to 22she Sraban on several occasions, but Dwitiyo Purush certainly isn't its sequel. Anirban puts up a fantastic performance in the climax sequence, but comes across as trying too hard to be a hardcore criminal mouthing his dialogues mostly. Parambrata is measured and expressive. Gaurav Chakraborty is passable as his assistant, but Raima Sen is largely wasted. The climax and the revelation of the motive are cleverly crafted and worth the wait.",Dwitiyo Purush,tt10778840

Srijit Mukherji again proved that whenever he'll come up with thriller again we could blindly trust him. Screenplay is good and the Climax is top-notch. Now Baishe Srabon is famous for its dialogues, here also Dialogues are very very good. Editing by Pronoy Dasgupta is perfect, some best dialogues of Prabir Roy Chowdhury from it's prequel is patched up here perfectly. Now again @Soumik Haldar has done a splendid job as cinematographer. In Baishe Srabon there were some long shots, here also the chasing sequence and long shots are there. Now coming to the performances, Parambrata Chattopadhyay has done a great job, Raima, Abir, Gourav, Rwitobroto, Subhra Sourav are also good... But the show stealer is of course Anirban Bhattacharya. Whenever he's in the screen, we can't move eyes from the screen. It was one of his best performances. Now the music by Anupam Roy is good, but if compared with Baishe Srabon it can't be matched. BGM possesses a very important role in thriller and here it is very strong.At the last, Dwitiyo Purush is firstly a very good love story and then a great thriller.",Dwitiyo Purush,tt10778840
834,sanjubhat,Dwitiyo Purush -A Dark Psychological thriller!!!,8,26 January 2020,"Movie review-Dwitiyo Purush (Bengali film)
#sanjuzzreviewsI am back with a review of the Bengali psychological thriller Dwitiyo Purush and a sequel to the 2011 Prosonjit starrer Baishe Srobon. A dark thriller indeed!!The events in the film happen nine years after Baishe Srobon and has two tracks which go back and forth in time.
The film starts off with a string of gory murders carried out by a young local goon khoka (Rwitobroto Mukherjee )and his gang in 1993. Khoka is caught and arrested by the police.
When he is finally released after 25 years ,the killings start again. Is this the work of a deranged serial killer or is there something more sinister to it?Paramabrata Chatterjee reprises his role as (Abhijit Pakrashi), the ace cop who specializes in catching serial killers, gives a restrained performance and is great as usual.
Anirban Bhatacharya as the sinister Khoka (grown up and shown in the present era) is the surprise package in the film and delivers a steller performance which will definitely send a chill down your spine.Raima sen (Amrita) and Abir Chatterjee (Shurjo) have small roles, do well and provide an emotional angle to the otherwise fast paced film.Gaurav Chakraborty as Paramabratas suave assistant does full justice to his role.Srijit Mukherjee is brilliant and the direction is really top class.My verdict:
Solid content, flawless narrative ,lives up to its cult classic prequel and is a treat to watch. If you have liked Baishe Srobon u will definitely enjoy this cat and mouse game between the cop and the serial killer . The climax has a twist which is unguessable to say the leastA must watch for all whodunnit fans. Not to be missed!!!",Dwitiyo Purush,tt10778840
835,Dibyayan_Chakravorty,Unnecessary Sequel,5,24 March 2020,"The film is a celebration of the grand hit first installment 'Baishe Srabon (2011)' and that's all. Poor screenplay as well as the silly twist ending ruins the entire film. I think this is Srijit Mukherji's 2nd unnecessary film after 'Begum Jaan (2017)' which is just a Hindi remake of 'Rajkahini (2015)'.

836,pritambag,Intense plot with not so great execution,6,29 April 2020,"The pick up tone of the film was very much unique. And the plot too developed in an intense manner. But somehow if the end was kept open and left for the audience it would have been the highest grossing film and plot itself would have created a lot of fanbase. But somehow the introduction of some bizzard logics related to mental health issues went over my mind. I was disappointed by the ending. But the performances were great including Parambrata Chattopadhyay, Anirban Bhattacharya and Rwitobrata Mukherjee.

It's high time that Srijit Mukherjee stops stealing scenes and storylines from others, and ceases to think of himself as Christopher Nolan or Satyajit Ray.

Parambrata tried to bring out the mental turmoil of his character but those were poorly directed scenes,those scenes don't match with the story at all. But mainly I am disappointed with Parambrata's character assassination. I recall the last scene of 22 se srabon vividly. Parambrata was genuinely caring person there but dwitiyo purush established him as something else all along. You know Srijit that you have put the movie location in kolkata Chinatown. Ironically the Jack Nicholson starrer 'Chinatown' was a great movie but it's sequel was a disaster. Your 22 se srabon franchise suffered the same fate. Similarly to Chinatown , dwitiyo purush is a mirror image of its predecessor and failed miserably.

842,Dips3105,Genius is made once not twice,5,16 January 2021,"Don't watch this one with a hangover of #BaisheySrabon. Because that is among one of a few cult movies ever made in the history of Bengali cinema. But still the story has not enough power to make another classic and at the same time, the execution this time is not quite good. But still, Srijit Mukherjee tried to pull up as much as he can do. The take away from the entire movie is only Anirban as Khoka and his lumpen swag and accent. He has just created his own world where no one can belong to his league. Raima didn't get enough space to do something. The story is completely around two main characters played by Anirban & Parambrata and their life and the rat n mouse game between these two. The twist and turn around in the climax is quite good which can give you a bit of shock, otherwise there is nothing to follow on. Gourab in the character of a Police Officer has put down the thing most, he never looks fit in this role, he just couldn't carry his role. Music is also not quite fascinating which can be remembered for a long.

843,priyadarshanmaity98,Somewhat derivative but a nice continuation,6,17 April 2020,"If you loved baisher shrabon you will be somewhat disappointed with this film cause it offers nothing new in the table atleast the first 2 acts. I for one missed Prosenjit in this film which is the biggest drawback cause it should be like a continuation where everything is in a different league altogether but that's what it is missing. The start of the film is reminiscent of other crime films like city of god, Angamaly diaries so nothing new and the starting impression really disappointed me but but... You will not get bored cause there is two of the greatest actors of the Bengali film industry one is Parambrata Chatterjee and the second is anirban bhattacharjya there performance elevated the film and the thing is there is a constant jabs at crime cliches the protagonist talks about you know talking about scottland yard but the cliche they are trying to diminish is actually the fault because they fall into the trap of this same cliche. But again the ending...it will shock you and I think Srijit Mukherjee wanted to create a illusion that the first and second act was just a cliche but the end will be the game changer yeah kind of game changing but ultimately the twist was shocking but again if you finished the film and started to think about it the first and second really somewhat ruined it so the ending doesn't make any impact whatsoever. And the twist which is original... Doesn't make any sense if you think about it maybe it will make sense but the whole thing was convoluted for worse.And the romance is lousy just like Raima Sen said in the film and her arc is tone deaf the new police officer Rajat is a dull character didn't made any impact. Overall the film is passable the technical aspects are nothing to talk about if you know Srijit da's work you know the style is similar. So watch it for the end and then think about it if it is making any sense",Dwitiyo Purush,tt10778840
844,shuvamdasgupta,Good Story...but really pretentious,7,21 March 2020,"A good ending. But the reason it is not a good sequel is because there is a gap in the storyline of Baishe Srabon and this movie. It felt like the director never planned for the second movie when he made the first one. The first one came organically to him and that is why it will always be one of the good Bengali movies. The second film is something that the director made may be under compulsion or may be just to make a sequel. So the sequel did not work for me. Anirban's acting is like he is acting on stage and is not natural. But rest of the actors are good.

846,banerjeenirmalya,"Dark, Bold and Tricky",9,23 January 2020,"Very rarely a great film receives a fitting sequel. Well, Srijit Mukherji ' s ""Dwitiyo Purush"" is one such rarity. An edgy script, brilliant direction and kick-ass performances of the two leads - Parambrata and Anirban make it a must watch. The film deals with a notorious criminal Khoka (Anirban) who's back from prison after serving a long sentence. During his teenage, Khoka headed a criminal gang and tormented the area of Chinatown. He committed multiple murders and each time the victims received the inscription ""Khoka"" on their forehead with a sharp object. After he's set free, identical murders resurface. Is Khoka again back in his own self after such a prolong period or is there someone or something else behind this is what the now Veteran Cop Abhijit (Parambrata) and his team must find out.It's not a conventional whodunit with twists and turns every now and then but rather a linear treatment with a gradual progression almost rendering it like a mixed genre film. Thus the sub plots like the Daal Bhat Biriyani one doesn't interrupt the flow but aids in this wholesomeness. However the film is not flawless. Music could have been a bit better. I felt the Police Department should have shown a bit more alacrity especially after the second murder.But the one thing that really stands out is the shock value. The twist is unpredictable and fleshed out to perfection. And as the saying goes ""All is well that ends well"", Dwitiyo Purush passes with flying colours and adds to Mukherji's tally of successful thrillers. He's no longer Bangalir Nolan. This one makes him Bangalir Fincher too.",Dwitiyo Purush,tt10778840

852,samantajoy-21465,This is a forced sequel,7,20 March 2020,"This has been forcefully made as sequel of ""Baishe Shrabon"" and if we even take it as a sequel then also it has failed drastically.
Performance is poor of everyone except Parambrata and Anirban,they are kind of okay.Rather I enjoyed watching the cut scenes of Prasenjit Chatterjee from ""Baishe Srabon"".
Story is okay but screenplay is weak and failed to create a thrilling experience.Climax is only good thing and really appreciable.
Overall you can watch it single time for timepass but it is not even comparable with ""Baishe Srabon""

It started well and also ended in a very good way, but in between these there's a big gap. It's lengthy and repetitive. So, you may lose your connection in many scenes.What I liked is director Indrasis Acharya has pointed out various issues of our community like unnecessary mob violence, health system in hospitals.Both Saswata Chatterjee and Rituparna Sengupta acted amazingly as always. Ambarish Bhattacharya is such a good actor. In his short screen time in every film he always proved that.

860,gdatta-14057,The Parcel of life!,1,13 June 2021,"One may say that a good film director is a sugarman of the soul for his audience. When a cinema finds vision in its construct and narratives, it is often apparent how consumption of the attributes in its form and content finds its own voice. The impact and sustainability of this often qualifies the director's 'cut'.Talking about Indrasis's 'The Parcel', I am strongly reminded of these characteristics and the becoming of his tread in this journey. This is existentially a socio-psychological nuance, in the realm of dark romanticism...the ethos of urban quaker. The objectivity underlying recurrent receipt of parcels from an unknown sender in a medical couple's family gradually unfolds into subjective torrents and tempest of inner and outer make of a man and woman. These take diverse routes yielding diverse behaviors, tending to converge often reluctantly, on a tea-table called home. Then there are new and old beginnings - perpetual hints of parallel or consequential events and escapades and fruitless aspirations to stitch the frays.The director has swept his wand with characteristic √©lan and equanimity. The cinematic language has been well-trodden, manifest even to an uninitiated reviewer like me. The form, content, music, experiments with script forms and shot forms, audio and visual editing and the overall cinematic narrative have surely marked this film as another phenomenal direction from the house of Indrasis, after 'Bilu Rakkhosh' and 'Pupa'.I was recently reading through an obituary of late maestro Buddhadeb Dasgupta by another stalwart director who talked about the passion to understand the inner nature of a human - individualistic or collective. It is often the overlapping orbits of diverse layers of balance that humans dynamically reside in. The chemistry is complex. Our young director of 'The Parcel' boldly explores this mist with a promising trademark of his own.",Parcel,tt10727128

Also, their presentation was so unpleasant. They presented their own movie, so it could've been way better. There was this irritating noise coming from the Soundsystem all the time. The projector they used was only 720p and it stopped working maybe two times during the show.
Despite all this, I support bangla movie industry. Hope they'll do better in future!

If we all think about the character of Ali Azgar in the movie Gondi at the crossroads of life, then thousands of such stories around us will come to light. It is very important that the director introduces the boundaries of friendship that are broken from the fence of the relationship. It is heartbreaking to see two talented actors from both Bengal and two other actors portraying their acting skills. Although nothing extraordinary, he deserves to be thanked for the way the director has made the familiar story into a movie.

883,reazrahmanxd,A movie filled with cliche storyline.,5,7 December 2019,"Parts that I didn't like -
1. Worst Ending
2. Clickbait type Poster
3. In some scenes, the acting of foreigners were really unnatural
4. Somebody said it is based on a real life story, didn't feel that way. Felt like a fully commercial typical movie with good cinematography.
5. Everything seemed unrealistic.
6. The whole movie was missing english or bangla subtitle, not everyone understands Chatgaiya Language
7. The team had the potential to make a amazing film but the story was very commercial in my opinion.
8. Didn't find the strong message of Women Empowermentparts that I did like-
1. Good filmmaking from bangladesh
2. Cinematography was great
3. Acting of Ayesha and Ayesha's Brother was good in my eyes
4. Some scenes were really eye pleasing.Overall,
This is not a good film nor a terrible film.
I just dont know, they have the potential to make a very good film, but things were filled with a lot of cliches that broke my heart. I think they can and they will make great films for us. At least they made something.",No Dorai,tt9892338

885,adnanbinrashid,No Dorai is,9,5 December 2019,"No dorai is a significant breakthrough for Bangladeshi movies. The cinematography and sound mixing was top notch. All of the 3 songs were brilliant. The cast, who were mostly new and young pulled of a fine job.
People have been complaining about the lack of surfing though. I do agree that surfing scenes were minimal. I think the movie could've gone in a different direction rather than promoting it in a way where the sole focus was surfing.
People were also complaining that the promoters said that it would be a movie about woman surfers being stigmatised by society who would be seen breaking those stigmas. But instead it was a movie where a woman surfer was mostly seen being abused and losing her fights constantly.
Well, I'd say the representation in the movie was damn correct. Because that's what happens in our society. Abuse against woman is very common everywhere, in this subcontinent. Seeing those things happen on screen in intense and difficult to swallow but it's necessary. It's necessary for people to see the truth and realize or try to understand a bit of what women go through in our society.
The story telling and character development deserves a ton of praise. I would like to congratulate everyone who were involved in making this movie. It was definitely a sensitive and difficult movie to take on and it must've been taken some brave people to take on this project.
I definitely recommend this movie to others. These types of movies can really improve the Bangladeshi film scene and take it to the next level. We have a lot of catching up to do with other film industries. But with these type of movies, we can move up fast.

887,Fahad-Shafin,"Honest review of No Dorai: Less surfing, more melodrama",4,9 December 2019,"The film does not live up to the hype
The movie buffs in Bangladesh have been eagerly waiting for the theatrical release of Bangladesh's first surfing film No Dorai (Dare to Surf). The film made hit the local theatres on Friday, despite a few complaints and edits from the censor board. A special premiere for the press and media personalities was held on Thursday evening. We rushed to take a first peek into the much-hyped drama, but was sorely disappointed.The premiere itself dazzled the guests. Celebrities, media personalities and government officials, not to mention the film's cast and crew, filled up the premises of Star Cineplex at Bashundhara City shopping mall in Dhaka.The film screening was supposed to begin at 7pm, but at 7:45pm, the film's producer and Star Cineplex Chairman Mahboob Rahman came on the stage and deeply apologized for the delay due to management issues.Speaking about the film, he said how months of hard work went into the making of No Dorai, how amazing a team was assembled by the film's executive producer and popular Bangladeshi musician Xefer Rahman, and how incredible the audience's response was.He said the film was inspired by the true story of a girl named Nasima, who overcame every barrier to fulfil her dreams to become a surfer in a religious conservative town like Cox's Bazar.Mahboob said this film was a movement to further propel women empowerment and a new era in Bangladeshi film industry.Beautiful visuals of Cox's BazarAs the film began, the audience was captivated by the stunning visuals of Cox's Bazar. Taneem Rahman, the film's director, and Sumon Sarker, the cinematographer, must be praised for capturing the beautiful visuals of the world's longest beach as never seen before. No Dorai can boast about having the most spectacular visuals and colours in any Bangladeshi film in recent times. The director himself is one of the most talented editors and colourists in the country, and the film's images reflect that.Oddly enough, the huge stain of dust on the screen was an eyesore, ruining the beautiful introduction sequence of Cox's Bazar beach and the roaring Bay of Bengal. Naturally, the audience complained. It was particularly baffling, seeing as Star Cineplex itself is the production company of the film, and one would expect them to take extra care while screening their debut production.Poor storytellingAlthough incredibly impressive, the beautiful visuals could do little to make up for subpar storytelling.The screenplay was co-written by Mahboob Rahman and renowned Indian screenwriter Shyamal Sengupta. All of the dialogues were in the local dialect of Chittagong, but no subtitles were provided. Many in the audience were confused, wondering about the subtitles as most of them could not understand a word of the dialogues. The film-makers should have taken this into consideration.The story revolves around Ayesha, played by newcomer Sunerah Binte Kamal, a teenager from Cox's Bazar who grew up surfing with her trainer Amir, played by Sayeed Babu. The story depicts the horrors she has to face since childhood, both in the hands of her family and the society, for her love of surfing on the waves of the Bay.The plot is unique and depicts one of the most crucial social issues of our country, which is repression of women and how the Bangladeshi society is built upon what women can and cannot do.However, this is not the way to start a massive conversation on such a sensitive issue like women empowerment. The intention and effort was evident, but their execution was not done well.Almost every dialogue sequence was laced with typical melodrama from the days of yore - the mould that recent movies have been trying to break. A lot of the sequences were redundant and could have been edited out.For example, in a scene, Ayesha's brother is seen beating her with a stick for going to surf in the sea, because it is not acceptable. The scene goes on and on for what feels like ages. In reality, if a person was beaten for so long and so brutally, surely that person would need to be hospitalized. Yet, our Ayesha walks again after a few days of bed rest.Actors shineThe acting was the only good thing about the film. The casting of local actors was great, and each actor played their part well. The performances of the lead actors, Sunerah who played Ayesha, and Sariful Razz who played Ayesha's romantic interest Sohel, were particularly admirable. The writers gave Sohel a sidekick, who was clearly meant to provide comic relief. Sadly, that does more harm than good; that supporting role mumbles random unnecessary things to keep the audience engaged, but fails.Each of the cast members are fluent in the Chittagonian dialect. The producer previously told the press that the actors went through months of training to learn the dialect.As far as acting is concerned, the same cannot be said for the foreign actors; they are stiff in their movement and robotic in delivering their dialogues.Bad sound-mixingThe sound of No Dorai, in short, is horrible. No live location sound was used in the movie. The dialogues were dubbed in post-production, and the lip syncs in the first few sequences are terrible.What I don't understand is how a production of this scale went with the ancient Automated Dialogue Replacement (ADR) process - and even that was done poorly. I would not call myself an expert in Chittagonian dialect, but even I could tell that the lip sync was completely off.The sound design, done by Ripon Nath, and mixing are mediocre. Some scenes have unnecessary sound effects. The surround mix is so bad that in some instances, you have to cover your ears because of how loud the background score is.The score could have been great if it wasn't so monotonous. There are some scenes that are visually striking and would've been perfect with just the sound of the ocean, but are ruined with local flute tunes which are not only unnecessary, but also poorly mixed.Where's the surfing?The biggest issue I have with this film is that, it is about local surfing culture, but there are barely any scenes of people surfing in the movie. The producer claims that Razz and Sunerah had three months of training to shoot the surfing scenes. We see Razz on a surfboard for a couple of seconds, but our protagonist, who fights for her right to be able to surf, is never seen on a surfboard in the film that is more than two and a half-hours-long. In one scene, Ayesha is seen jumping into the sea with her surfboard, but in the following shot, we see a match cut of someone else surfing with the board - wearing the same clothes. Some of the audience burst into laughter seeing this scene.The verdictWith the glaring errors in the film, the question is: Was the hype justified? Certainly not. No Dorai could not achieve what it set out to do. The film was widely anticipated around the country, with its amazing soundtrack Jontrona by the talented young singer Mohon Sharif, brilliantly shot by the director. Another good part of this movie is the amazing depiction of Cox's Bazar's natural beauty as never seen before. The lead actors also deliver good performances. Unfortunately, the bads outweigh the goods.But the movie shows the personal progress of the director. No Dorai was Taneem Rahman's third film - after Aadi and Shopner Ghor. Among them, Aadi never received a theatrical release. He is a promising film-maker who is getting better with each project and has a thirst for giving the audience something new.",No Dorai,tt9892338

Went in without much expectation having read the negative review written by Dhaka Tribune but the film turned out to be pretty amazing. This beach town surf drama was visually stunning, had a compelling story line with emotionally charged acting and great directions. Also the tasteful original soundtrack successfully complimented the ambience of the film. As it is a Bangladeshi film maybe I'm being a little biased but very much tempted to give it a 5 out 5. Recommended to watch at the cinema.

But surprisingly this movie came out to be fast paced in terms of its genre, which is a Biography. Beside the protagonists, the other significant characters gave much more definition to the story. Kudos to the direction, cinematography, BGM, and obviously the Soundtracks. The screenplay could have been more compact and powerful. Other than that, it was a well made movie.

They could have given the scripts to my niece, even she could have come up with a better ending. And what was all that crap saying 'based on a true story' crap I don't know. You would think from the poster and all other stuff that the movie is filled with surfing from that girl, but all she did in the entire story was get beaten up by her brother. Also they should have added subtitles.
Summing it all up: Not worth the money.Few (only a few pluses): The way they presented Cox's Bazar and that boy playing ayesha's brother.

904,Arinha_Adhikari,A romantic tale,9,25 May 2021,"It basically a romantic tale about two poeple brought together by their love for cooking. Although the plot is simple but the emotive acting by Arifin Shuvoo (bangladesh) and measured acting of Rituparna in the role of Basundhara makes it a memorable watch. This movie interweave West Bengal and Bangladesh through food. Any bengali viewers can related to the movie more emotionally. Notably the film has a Indo Bangladesh casting justifying the plot. Interestingly It is one of the few movies made with food as a protagonist and has been choosen in ""25 great Asian films about food"".

The film peaks mainly during the emotional scenes and some of the scenes can be tear jerkers so don't forget to put some tissues with you while watching this flick.
The film although presented as a comedy gives us a deep social message regarding.... (won't tell you. See the film üòé)The only negatives were some of the scenes where there was over the top acting and huge disconnect between the emotional scenes and the comedy scenes. It felt like that the comedy scenes and emotional scenes each belong to a different film which shouldn't have been the case.Jeet has sort of reinvented himself with this film and I sincerely hope that he continues with the good work.

916,SoumikBanerjee25,"Just Decent, That's it.",6,16 April 2020,"Well as a Bengali myself, I don't watch much Bengali movies. And trust me I feel guilty sometimes. As there are countless interesting films coming up every week here regionally. But this is not one of those. Certainly not. It's more of a Typically bengali flavoured dish presented with a Polished modern day touch.Mystery thrillers are a trend in Bengali culture for so many decades now. There are numerous films based upon the same genre. Yet it never gets outdated nor boring. If done properly though. Here it's a mix bag. Let me elaborate.I liked the most of its presentation a mystery, treasure hunt movie. But there are some obvious flaws too. Apparently Typical bengali movies comes with this Cliched touches in them. Usually they don't bother much all the time as it profoundly represents our culture and traditional beliefs too. Sometimes it gets too much to handle. And that's a thin line. This one crosses that line on few occasions and That did bother me. Especially with some lesser important characters.The cinematography & the background score was the highlight of this movie. With some good chemistry working between the lead protagonists. Others have done pretty decent jobs too on their parts as well. There's a twist in the end that got me by surprise to be honest. I didn't see it coming at all. For the historical lessons, I seriously don't know much about the authenticities nor do I care much.
The VFX team has surely done some impressive work on the architectural details.It indeed delivers just fine on what it promised on the front, so not much complaints with that. But with the bigger possibility in hands of becoming a memorable addition in the genre. it's certainly a missed opportunity.",Durgeshgorer Guptodhon,tt9537068

Cast&Story: Sonada(Abir), Abir(Arjun) and Jhinuk (Ishaa) visit the Debroy household during Durga Puja only to stumble upon on a treasure hunt that leads them to the fortune hidden in the family's old ancestral mansion, Durgeshgor Review: The flim is, above all, a two-hour-long lesson on Bengal's rich history and traditions.

It seems to take too long to pick up pace, making the first half a bit of a drag.
But apart from the obvious depth of research behind the script, the film definitely earns additional brownie points for the visuals and the music, which is an integral part of the treasure hunt. It's the songs and the lyrics that keep unveiling the clues that guide Sonada and team towards the treasure hidden in Durgeshgor. The visuals have a rustic rural charm that we greatly miss amidst the humdrum of city life. Even the depiction of Durga Puja in the Debroy household has been kept to the bare necessities, highlighting only the parts which are relevant to the storyline. Had the focus been more on this aspect of the celebrations, even the second half would have been slowed down beyond repair. It's also apparent that a lot of research has gone into choosing the right locations and creating the right clues. But the visual effects-laced scene in which Arjun dives into a village pond to find a clue could have been a bit more realistic. No, there's nothing wrong with the effects. It's the duration for which Arjun aka Abir, someone who has recently learnt how to swim, holds his breath that makes it a bit unbelievable. A few seconds more and he could have beaten a rookie free diver! Moreover, he seems to be breathing normally underwater. No bubbles flow out of his mouth or nostrils, which seems a bit unnatural.Even the visibility inside the water, and that too in the evening, is a tad unrealistic.",Durgeshgorer Guptodhon,tt9537068

929,msunando,A cathartic face off between love and responsibilities,8,31 May 2020,"Kaushik Ganguly brings back the protagonists of Bisorjon (the film that won the National Award for the Best Bengali Feature Film in 2017) into its sequel in Bijoya. Six years have passed since Nasir Ali (Abir Chatterjee) made his way back to India after a tumultuous few weeks at Sripur in Bangladesh, Padma (Jaya Ahsan) is married to Ganesh Mondol (Kaushik Ganguly) as she had promised and has a son Montu. Only Padma is aware that Nasir Ali is Montu's real father and she would rather keep it that way for everyone's benefit, but destiny has different plans for them, as Ganesh's ailing heart brings all the characters to a battlefield again, this time in Kolkata. This time around, facts and secrets will rise to the surface from the depths, challenging loyalties, love, responsibilities and the matters of the heart. Bijoya is about the complexity that arises when Ganesh Mondal and Nasir Ali face off with each other, both professing love for Padma, and yet, the former requesting Nasir Ali to support Padma and her son when death strikes. It is about Padma's reactions, helplessness, the strife between her love and responsibilities and finally, the strength of her character.The film totally belongs to Jaya Ahsan. She picks up the pieces from where she left them in Bisorjon and delivers perfection. Kaushik Ganguly gives himself a larger role and belts out a credible and cracking performance too. Comparatively, Abir comes across as somewhat subdued and shaky, but far better than what he did in Bisorjon. Mind you, there are enough spoilers in this otherwise gripping love triangle, like how easy is it to cross borders without documentation at will, or how does a Bangladeshi citizen get admission in a to notch private hospital without adequate identification documentation, among the many more. These aside, Bijoya makes for a captivating watch for its compact storytelling and the ace performances of Jaya Ahsan and Kaushik Ganguly.",Bijoya,tt9537054

1. Solid script.
2. Excellent performances from everyone.
3. Wow music.
4. Excellent direction and narration of the movie.Note: dialogue delivery of Koushik Ganguly was incredible.Ending was a little bit predictable.

941,senofcal,Faulty Storyline,6,13 January 2019,"The movie is a shadow of it's previous version, Bisorjon. The only redeeming feature is Abir Chatterjee's better acting compared to the earlier one. Kaushik Ganguly and Jaya Ahsan play their roles well.
The fault one lies in Ganesh Mondal being a severely disabled heart patient performing his daily chores with ease. He has to be on supplemental oxygen, but takes off the mask and behaves as a normal person.
Second, he and his family smuggle into India without any valid permit (passport). Then gets admitted to a Corporate Hospital without a passport, leave alone a Medical Visa, which is the basic prerequisite for admission. And the timeline of the event is quite recent as the money changing hand is after demonitization.
Being the only worthwhile director of Bengali movies, it's sad that he failed to get proper guidance from the research team giving him advice on this front.

950,anjumhaz,An attempt to adapt Chowringhee,5,3 October 2021,"The movie is an adaptation of Shankar's acclaimed novel 'Chowringhee', though the context is changed to recent time.It's very hard to convey a 500 pages book's story with a two-and-a-half hours of clip. And the expectation from the director gets really high, since 'Chowringhee' has been receiving the praise from its readers for more than 50 years! But I don't know how many days people will remember 'Shah Jahan Regency'.The movie starts with promise. The first half kept me cheerful. I was meeting the characters from the book. Due to time consistency, only a few of the stories and characters got place in the movie. I missed the atmosphere of the book after the first half. The scenes seemed to adapt only the dramatic sides of Chowringhee and not the deep insights.All the actors and actresses played their roles nicely except Rittika Sen's acting felt very artificial to me. She played an important role- Suprita. Originally 'Sujata' of the novel. I was disappointed to discover that Suprita's character was anything but an adaptation of Sujata. Suprita is an air-hostess, I think they have to put an artificial smile on the face always for their profession, but meh, I didn't see any other natural side of the character.I would say, if you have read the book, no need to try the movie. Nothing can replace the amazing experience you get reading this book, spending hours to know the characters. (In my opinion, only a few directors can preserve the essence of a book in the movie. Rituporno Ghosh was one of them.) And if you try the movie, it might be an average experience for you.",Shah Jahan Regency,tt9468400

A film is NOT something which, despite of horrible making, can be enjoyed thoroughly. In order to be a good film, therefore, one need to take some special attention to the 'craft', to the building block of cinema, which present Bengali Cinema, along with Srijit Mukherjee lacks brilliantly.Watching a movie like this, you'd think, this director doesn't know, how to make shot counter shot, how to construct a story according to its internal logic, how to construct a scene according to the whole story. This whole film is the collection of ill made scenes, as I've said previously. The director failed pain strikingly even to tell a story in a cinematic way.Cinematic TRASH!

959,neilsc-48285,Worth a watch,7,28 November 2019,"This movie is a modern day adaptation of Chowranghee, with the taste of today's Kolkata, it's hotel culture, super fancy and poshy lifestyle and the consequences comes along them. You can expect the normal Srijit Mukherjee kinda direction in this movie too, a set of some really good cinematic shots will surely amaze you.
Here in this movie 4 different stories of different people revolves around a Hotel, named Shah jahan regency. Though there are many loopholes, many imperfections in the script but the sadist storyline and the power of consecutive deaths in the script keep the audience glued to their seats. (Spoiler alert)
Coming to the star cast and acting perspectives, this movie surely has a number of very strong and sharp castings, however I felt like Rittika Sen should have done this better.
In brief, this film is surely not the perfect improvised and modernized version of 1968 Chowranghee, but this surely worths a watch.",Shah Jahan Regency,tt9468400

There are some movies which are just mere watches but there are some which just stay with you always.
This movie is of of a novice who joins a hotel and his experience of how a hotel functions and how each room has a story to tell.
The emotions, dilemma, etc are are seen and captured wonderfully through all its multi-starer cast .
More and more can be said but this movie has to be seen for its exceptional acting, accurate and precise screenplay and not to forget the very engaging ,
personal and microscopic cinematography.
Life goes on is the very crux of this masterpiece.
A marvelous ode to the city of joy.

I love how the cast includes some of the finest actors/actress of the bengali movie industry of present time and how they have outperformed themselves.
I have been re-watching this movie whenever i feel like it's been some time since I last saw it and when i have some time to spare..Shah Jahan Regency, the movie, made me feel things as if i was the one being portrayed on screen. I just find it very soothing to watch every time.Especially if you're fond of the city and the culture, chances are you'll thoroughly enjoy this, too.I do honestly hope i get to see more movies of this kind by similar cast working together.

Apart from Abir Chatterjee all of the crew members have done a fantastic job. Parambrata Chatterjee has been outstanding throughout the film. He even outclasses a dignifed actor like Anirban Chatterjee in certain scenes and last but not the least Srijit has discovered Swastika Mukherjee in a new way. Her screen presence, acting, dialogue delivery outclasses all. It's beyond 'outstanding', beyond any comments. 9/10

Really bad script, overacting Of Rudranil, really bad acting of all the side actors. One man who tried hard is Kaushik Ganguly, but because of the bad direction he also does not stand out. Indradrep Dasgupta is a really good music director, and he should stick to that only.

It's one of the most beautiful, moving scenes I've seen in a long while. The film is full of the feebleness and vulnerability of users, the innocence and childlike state of mind and being of users, the users in this film are grown up men but also lost little boys, who you want to go give a hug to every once in a while. Even murder is accidental because they're not even really aware. Everything is an impulse untempered by a rational reigning in. Performances were stellar. Saurabh, with the way he uses language and his eyes, conveying so much, tanmay as the man in the lungi, so at ease with that lungi that it remains in your mind hours later, the way he deals with it. Ronny and his last ditch effort to save himself and his friend who lands up seeing a man die as a crow leaves his head, the religious ritual both mocked and completed at once.

The film doesn't have a storyline in the sort of way like requiem for a dream, but is a more candid look in the lives of who are drug addicts. There are scenes which are stark cold and ironic like the father who does dope in front of their son, while the TV is singing some old bollywood song. He later after having put his son to bed, goes our trafficking and looking for money. Next we have the middle aged heroin dealer who is part of the narcotics and customs but sells them to college students. They have an almost satirical conversation, with many insider jokes and topics including the brutality of the police on suspects. And we have protagonist figure two friends who settle in an abandoned flight to smoke heroin. There story has a wider prtion that the other two.I felt the characters lacked depth and were in essence following one scene to the other in apt repetition of their drug abuse. The camera had better coverage on the whereabouts and obfuscates certain alleys trying to capture a noirish atmosphere.Though uncertain with their lives they live on the edges of drug abuse and poverty, struggling with losses. The film somehow doesn't make the audience engage to their inner feelings, so it is hard to feel any sympathy for them. Overall an honest effort.",Cat Sticks,tt9348546
981,msunando,Some aspects of culture are not expendable,8,24 April 2020,"Mahalaya (Bengali film on YouTube) - There are some things eternal, etched in our ethos, culture and hearts, rooted into our very existence. These aren't expendable or awaiting the mercy of a transformation to keep pace with times. They humbly yet fascinatingly transcend the boundaries of time and the numerous generations like an heirloom. ""Mahishasuramardini"" (Mahalaya, in the common parlance) is one such achievement of the quintessential Bengali culture - it is the oldest running radio programme of Akashvani (All India Radio) that has withstood the many challenges, trials and tribulations of time but stands rock solid in its place in our hearts. Originally written in 1931 by Bani Kumar, its music was composed by Pankaj Kumar Mullick and has Chandipath and other narration by the irrepressible Birendra Krishna Bhadra. The annual playback of the Mahishasuramardini's devotional songs and chants stand as a harbinger of the Durga Puja season, and despite many attempts by the scores of television channels, Bengalis across the world prefer to listen to this program that heralds the invocation of the Goddess in early autumn.Mahalaya, the film is produced by Prasenjit and directed by Soumik Sen. It describes an ill fated and botched attempt by the ministry of broadcasting to replace the program with a more shiny, newer version having roped in the best musical talent of the country across Calcutta and Bombay in 1976. The responsibility of scoring the music was given to Hemanta Mukherjee, who was eager to move out of the shadow of his mentor and guru, Pankaj Kumar Mullick, and he convinced Manna Dey, Lata Mangeshkar and Asha Bhonsle to sing for it. The biggest coup was to bring on board Uttam Kumar, the mahanayak and superstar of Bengali cinema to replace Birendra Krishna Bhadra as the narrator. Although initially unconvinced about his own ability, he agreed to the experiment after meeting his predecessor and seeking his blessings. However, the attempt met with a colossal failure as the listeners thumbed down the version immediately, and Uttam Kumar himself admitted that his own rendition didn't quite foster the effect of the usual curtain raiser for Durga Puja. It led to All India Radio to quickly backtrack and play the original version as if for tendering an apology to the nation on the day of Shashthi theatre same year, thus placating the angered Bengali audience.Subhashis Mukherjee plays Birendra Krishna Bhadra with a masterful elan, Subhamoy Chatterjee plays Pankaj Kumar Mullick with authority, Saptarshi Roy acts out Hemanta Mukherjee living the conflict and complex and Jishu shines as Uttam Kumar. Mahalaya is a must watch film for all generations to connect to the roots and take pride in our culture.",Mahalaya,tt9179414

987,suprabhattacharya,A mature work from window production,8,30 May 2020,"Based on Bibhuti Chatterjee's fight with cancer, the director duo of Shibu-Nondita has brought to screen a glorious tale of hope, emotion and redemption. Konttho is a triumph of poignant story telling .The film explores the trials and tribulation of Arjun the RJ who has lost his voice due to cancer, and his struggle to resume his career. The film vividly portrays the depression, anger, denial of Arjun after losing his voice and parallely the impact of him on his family who were supportive and sympathetic .
Konttho is rich but not overindulgent on emotion i.e devoid of synthetic emotions and overdamatic situations.The originality of the film depends on the simple dialogues which is one of the strongest department of this Shibu-nandita duo especially the dialogues of Romila the voice therapist of Arjun .Her dialogues have been written with enviable simplicity. The performances have been pillars of the film.
Paran Bandhopadhay and Koneenica Banerjee are effective in their short roles.Paoli Dam with her usual grace has made her role as a grieving, sensible and supportive wife more relevant.
Shiboprasad has been at his best portraying a large range of emotions effortlessly,he made the role of Arjun his own with acute precision.He makes his character speak with silence and convey with his expressive eyes.
As I already said,the dialogues written for Romila the voice therapist are very relevant and an example of excellent dialogue writing,but that would have been not so much effective if Jaya Hasan was not chosen to play that role. She was radiant and has left no stone unturned to bring life to the character she is playing.The performance of Jaya Hasan has pioneered the second half of the film.The film's credit lies in the approach of a sensitive topic with sheer simplicity.
The film's technical department has done a commendable work and so has the sound mixing department.Konttho is the most mature film from the director duo and really a film worth remembering.",Konttho,tt9110380

994,kinshasanakamura,SHIBOPROSAD DELIVERS AN ONCE IN A LIFETIME PERFORMANCE,9,19 May 2019,"Pronounced Kawn-ThoDirector: Shiboprosad Mukherjee, Nandita Roy
Year: 2019
Genre: Drama
As with all other film industries, and maybe more than many others, Tollywood is ridiculed for its disappointing remakes and predictable action flicks, but even with dozens of soulless flicks being produced, directors like Shiboprosad and Nandita are keeping the artistic, beautiful storytelling alive, and they deserve a boatload of credits for their attempts.I have seen most of Shiboprosad and Nandita's combined directorial movies, and 'Kontho', to me is the best amongst all of the movies they ever made. And this comes from a fan of other films they made, full of soul and beauty; Indeed, 'Kontho' is on a different level.In the age of devastation caused by Cancer, 'Kontho' tries to give the affected a hope to survive, especially those afflicted by throat cancer. The leading character here, RJ Arjun (a radio jockey), suffers throat cancer and an operation removes his larynx. The story that continues is a tremendous showing of how quickly the diseased can come back when they are kept mentally warm.Shiboprosad, the co-director himself, plays the lead role of RJ Arjun, making a grand comeback to acting after an inexplicable hiatus (the role in 'Haami' wasn't a lead role, ofcourse). When the movie starts, He plays the role of a RJ perfectly, mesmerizing us with his voice and his speaking skills, all while we see him helping people out mentally, through the voice of the radio, including saving a girl from an immediate suicide.Although Arjun brings happiness to the listeners of his show, and his family and friends are close to him, his quarter-century year long smoking habit results in throat cancer, and a surgery saves his life while taking away his biggest asset, his voice. His character then rapidly changes, playing emotionally volatile as a man would be under such circumstances.Shiboprosad brings his full might into this power-packed performance, earning sympathy and admiration from the viewers. He shows such tremendous comfort as a 'speechless' man that it seems almost magically real. One of the best single performances I have ever seen, and I hope he gets some much-deserved awards for this performance.Obviously, Arjun couldn't have succeeded without the help of his family and friends. Paoli Dam plays his wife, showing love and concern for her husband, while also showing childish envy towards his speech teacher Romila Chowdhury (Jaya Ahsan). This Romila helps Arjun in the most unpredictable yet highly accurate ways, and feels an attraction towards him at the end. Koneenica Banerjee plays Indrani, a friend who vows to never 'leave Arjun alone' and keeps his promise.Comedy is an influential part of this film. Pritha's father joking about the financial instability of RJs was pretty funny. The iconic veteran Paran Bandopadhyay and fellow veteran Chitra Sen brings more humor into the fray.This redemption-based story couldn't have survived without a few twists or two, one of which links Arjun to Romila in a clever way. Again, the story is sometimes predictable and drags somewhat in the second half, but the knock-out ending throws away the little drag to a considerable distance.The background music is fitting to the scenes needing it, especially a recurring theme. And the songs, one of which I presume is by Anupam Roy are excellent to listen to.If you like Bengali or regional movies, then do watch this, atleast for this once in a lifetime performance by Shiboprosad.CONCLUSION: 'Kontho', an admirable story of a cancer survivor never giving up, is fueled by Shiboprosad's performance of a lifetime, and beauty to help us smile.4.3/5",Konttho,tt9110380
995,pankajsanyal,Superb and inspirational,1,12 May 2019,"Konttho is a story of not giving up against all the odds.The wonderful orator,speaker whose struggle of returning back to his normal life with mechanized voice after the surgery for throat cancer.A voice which is the music to ears and voice which is motivation for millions.A story of hope, a story of friendship, a story of struggle - Konttho, is about the indomitable human spirit.
Kudos to Jaya Ahsan for learning to speak in esophageal voice..

1015,msunando,"Dark, sombre and luscious suspense",9,9 February 2019,"TRITIYO ADHYAY - I cannot obviously let out the intelligent and finely balanced plot of this romantic thriller, not because the film's makers requested us not to, but because it deserves not to be told. A young collegiate couple finds love and solace in each other even though individually they are very different from each other. A man is looking for his estranged father in a corner of Jharkhand, until he bumps into his past love interest. The tales are somehow connected, and so instincts tell us. What we discover is a dark, delightful and riveting story that takes the suspense to a crescendo.Abir Chatterjee is brilliant in playing the brooding and secretive Koushik. He underplays the remorse and angst of the character with gusto. Paoli Dam is a fine combination of determination and secrecy. She emotes through expressions that narrate a million experiences of pain and pathos. The locales and photography are brilliant, and the film has the right length to keep the viewers curious about how the third chapter will end. Let me congratulate Manoj Michigan for pulling off this Shakespearean styled thriller of modern times. I rate is 9 STARS.Please don't miss this movie. It's dark, luscious and sombre, interwoven with a suspense that you knew instinctively, but I didn't want to end the day it did. I wonder if the lead pair would also have felt the same way.",Tritio Adhyay,tt8427178

1021,arunavaray,A Master Story teller reading his story through Celluloid,1,28 February 2019,"Tritiyo Adhyay brings Bengali cinema into a new era of serious romantic thriller film. The storyline started with a lot of confusions and misleadings ending up with a simple story of lovers who give their lives for each other like the mainstream Hindi Feature of 1981- Ek Duje Ki Liye. The entire film was like a book reading session skipping between chapters, a master way of telling a story on the celluloid, which is rarely seen in the World Cinema. Manoj A. Michigan, the Director of the film came a long way from Hello Kolkata, Damadol, 89, Ami Joy chatterjee to Tritiyo Adhyay, a master story teller from his childhood.
The intercuts between the teenage college goer couple and the adult Abir Chatterjee looking for his author father S K Chattopadhyay were tactfully timed. The DoP of Tritya Adhyay, Supriyo Dutta had some fantastic technical shots from drones and illustrated Deogarh beautifully. He is a Cinematographer of World class. A scene that kept me thinking is when we see Abir shoot a target in a fish market and the target falls on a heap of fishes and we a fish gasping for breath.Abir and Paoli played their roles beautifully with their powerful acting skills. Sourav and Arunima, the new faces in the silver screen matched the standards of their counterparts of Abir and Paoli. The interesting part of the film was the humble servant, David whose role was played by the Director himself in a broader appearance than that of Hitchcock. Orin Prosenjit Das who scored the film fabulously added to the suspense of this romantic thriller.
Sanglap Bhowmik have improved his skills in editing to a level that he has mastered the timings of cutting between the shots. Incidentally we see him as great singer.
Manoj A. Michigan is versatile story teller from Comedy, family drama to romantic thriller gives us a hope of seeing more variety of his story telling.",Tritio Adhyay,tt8427178

1023,rudrachaudhuri,Its not that simple,1,16 February 2019,"'Tritiya Adhai' is the present offering from Dir Manoj Michigan,the man who made '89'.
U can easily break the film into pre interval and post interval.The pre interval is just the placing of the plot,build up of the characters,introduction of the story,U might get bored and ask urself ""Did this Man made 89?"".
Then there comes the post interval and it would blow ur mind away,the unpredictability,the twist the suspense would take u by surprise,and finally when the climax comes u r already emotionally attached to it.
Then u would tell urself ""Yes this Man made 89""

The first half sets up a beautiful romantic track, with melodious songs from Orin and amazing cinematography, you are drawn in from the start. Your invested in the story, the couple but you also sense the mystery lurking around. And then in the second half Manoj with his classic suspense streak brings in the raw emotions. As audiences by this time you are invested and oscillating between fear for the characters and extreme agony for them. I don't wish to spoil the plot, so know this- it is a love story, albeit filled with suspense and tragedy but it is love till eternity. The young brigade is brilliant, Abir comes in with a formidable performance especially in the second half and Paoli brings in a nuanced performance. Manoj gives a wonderful cameo and you are left wondering what can't this guy do? The stars of the movie--the characters and their stories and the brilliant editing. The story makes you forget the actors and the editing makes sure that you are always hooked. So please go out and watch this film-watch it for the brilliant acting, the wonderful story, the amazing songs, watch it for love- the one that stays for eternity.... Hazar Bochor!

1029,arnabghosh-43764,Splendid Movie with Wonderful Performances,9,18 February 2019,"Had an opportunity to see this wonderful new movie from director Manoj Michigan. Shot in around Deoghar, the bleakness of the surroundings amidst the desolate greens and the barren hilltops, succeeds in creating an atmosphere that in itself is a true reflection of the state of minds of the two protagonists, Shreya and Koushik, played admirably by Paoli and Abir. A love story in its essence, the plot progresses in an asymmetric and non synchronous pattern, being presented as chapters picked at random from a trilogy. This ensures that the story is never short on suspense and anticipation, and culminates with an unexpected twist. Suffice it is to say that the movie is a labour of love for both the director as well as the crew. Unusual casting, beautiful cinematography and good scripting makes this move quite an edge of the seat spectacle.

Finally, found this movie online and watched it last night. First of all, definitely this movie is not his best work, like bow barracks forever or Ranjana, but this movie is his best work in last few years, I guess the last good movie he made was Dutta vs dutta.
anyway, the movie has three different stories, where main characters are dealing with love from in different situations.I just want to talk about the third story, ""HIV POSITIVE."" where anirban Bhattacharjee is protagonist and what a performance he showed!! the guy is a star! hats off honestly. Personally i believe he deserves a national award for that role. In the story, anirban lives in a hospice and most of the time he lies down in bed and a male nurse just takes cares of him whole time and somehow a friendly bond creates between them. This story made me emotional, i don't even remember when the last time any kolkata movie touched me that much and every dialogues anirban delivered were flawless and couldn't be better. People who wanna learn acting, definitely check it out this performance. Only for, ""HIV POSITIVE"" I would say watch this movie.

So the usual excitement was generally there when this film got announced. Even after watching the trailer; I kept my hope. Too bad, that didn't turn out fruitful! Very sluggishly written plot, with performances and not much sense in the story made me cringe the entire run time. I was just thinking, how bad this film could gradually be! I could have easily overlooked the technical deficiencies had the story been satisfying! But I couldn't fathom the stupidity it holds. I was just so surprised at the fact that the makers have so badly exploited the opportunity of bringing the nostalgic element to a Shanku Movie. And what can I say about the 'Acting'; or should I use the prefix 'Over' before it! The amount of cringe was overwhelming. As an Avid reader of Shanku Series written by the Great Satyajit Ray; I am thoroughly disgusted on this movie representation. Not at all recommended.

1037,msunando,Perhaps somewhat jaded and obsolete a concept for the modern science and technology,4,23 December 2019,"Professor Shonku O El Dorado - Based on the original story ""Nakur Babu O El Dorado"" by Satyajit Ray that featured in Anandamela in 1980, this film doesn't waste any time and gets into the action quite hurriedly. The storyline is almost 4 decades old, but its backdrop is modern (2019, thus giving the adventure a feel of obsolescence, in spite of a glossy presentation. The science fiction that's forty years old fails to create the intended astonishment among the audience as over the last couple of decades, viewers have been exposed to humongous development of science and technology, and western films have created a deep impact already. Now with Netflix and Amazon Prime in our living rooms, Professor Shonku appears jaded, tired and grossly outdated. I am not so certain even if children will be thrilled with this presentation. Nevertheless, Dhritiman Chatterjee is sophisticated and suave, albeit lacking the energy to pull through the film for his own intrinsic value.

1039,chowdhurytuhin,Boring and Jagged screenplay,5,3 April 2020,"My review is purely based on my perspective as an audience. I do read good stories as well.
1. This character of Shoku by Satyajit Ray has a nostalgic value for most of Bengali children of the 80s and 90s. Portraying him with mobile phones and laptops doesn't really strike the right cord.
2. Using VfX should be logical and shouldn't be used unnecessarily. Like there is a scene where Shonku dials or saves number from a holographic gadget. Why? If you have more convenient mobile phone. The teleconference by a holographic projector seemed unconvincing. It would have been better if all the guys were sitting as normal instead of floating over the table. Eg. In Avenger movies.
3. The screenplay was so boring that I had to fast forward a lot. The scenes of people travelling were... of only them travelling and driving, nothing else.
4. The story should have taken place in the 80s.
5. The acting all around was mediocre. Seemed like the casting director had hired some foreign tourists with elementary acting skills.
6. Only good part is the effort put in and indeed the professionals behind the camera have worked hard but the whole thing fell apart due to poor conceptualizing and screenplay.",Professor Shanku O El Dorado,tt8364102

1041,Pabitrabadhuk,Professor Shanku experiment fails to amaze,7,22 December 2019,"I want to start the review by appreciating Sandip Ray and team for venturing into the audacious task of bringing Professor Shanku from pages into the screen. The biggest challenge in filming Shanku is the necessity for advanced graphics and exotic location shoot. While camera work in the streets of Sao Paolo and bird's eye views of the amazon rain forest catches attention, the VFX team has done a mediocre job at best. Acting through out the film has been reasonably good from the Indian actors. Dhritiman as Professor Shanku seems unnecessarily annoyed at times but overall has portrayed the character well. Subhashis Chakraborty fits in the role of Nakur babu perfectly too. However, the foreign actors in the roles of Dr. Sauders and Krol are too expressive, even tiring at times. The use of music in the film is commendable, enhances the cinematic experience. Sandip Ray has not veered far off from the Satyajit Ray school of music, the tunes in the movie sometimes reminded me of the Feluda theme. However, the main issue with the movie to me is it fails to hold your attention. There is no build-up of suspense, no sequence for provoking thought in the audience; It's more like a grand Brazilian travelogue. I would like to see more audience engagements in the upcoming Shanku ventures.",Professor Shanku O El Dorado,tt8364102
1042,coolboymohit-75028,Simple and pleasing movie,8,1 October 2020,"Many people were complaining about this movie that it was boring, poor scripting and other stuff like that. This movie is based on a short story in the Professor Shonku series written by Satyajit Ray in 1960's. If you haven't read any story of Prof. Shonku then for your kind information, making a Prof. shonku movie is very tough, VERY tough.
The first story is about Prof. Shonku's space journey where he meets aliens, the second story is about Egyptian adventure with mysteries of mummies... I think you get it now that this was the only story in which least CGI effects could be used.
The overall movie is well done. Sandip Ray may not be a legendary director like Satyajit Ray but he makes simple heartwarming movies.
I love the effort in the movie given by all the cast, especially by Dhritiman Chatterjee who played the role of Professor Shonku.
It was a great movie and worth watching.

He has made atleast watchable Feluda movies and series with the help of Same background music, same characterization, same screenplay style created by Genius Satyajit Ray.
Now in case of Professor Shonku, it debuts on the big screen holding hand of Sandip ray and sadly but expectedly Sandip ray let Professor Shonky down miserably.

We loved the fact that it wasn't a film set too far in the past. My son rarely sits quiet at a movie theater, but in this movie, he sat past the credits and kept talking about all the amazing things shown and the different scenes well after the movie got over.I recalled reading some Satyajit Ray books I had read as a child and recall the magic I felt reading them when I was young. Those books made me feel that the whole world had so much of magic, so much of wonder, and how there were great people amongst us and how the scientists and inventors of the entire world were a group trying to imagine the impossible and make it real.All those feelings and memories came back when I watched the movie.As I said, our whole family enjoyed it and kept talking about bits of the movies for days after.Thank you to everyone who showed us the magic of Satyajit Ray's story-telling.",Professor Shanku O El Dorado,tt8364102

Visuals of the Brazil landscape are the main attraction, but has been underplayed.Anaconda scene, ElDorado scenes could have been longer and more spectacular.Dialogues delivery is much too slow, deliberate and uninteresting across the board.Unnecessary scenes are too lengthy. Hotel scenes should have been a minimum, while adventure in Amazon Forest, ElDorado should have been emphasized.Does the director really have to spend so much time on characters introducing themselves to each other, painfully slowly. Who does that in real life ?!

This is the same review I had submitted in bookmyshow. The character depths of Shonku, Nokur, Saunders, Krol, all have been brought out in an excellent manner. Dhritiman and Subhashis deserve special mention... The play of emotions on Subhashis' face when he reports Shanku about the scanning of his papers at night was brilliant... VFX was far far better than Obhijaan... Dhritiman was finally the proper Shanku I was waiting after watching disappointing stage adaptations of the first few shanku stories which portrayed a comicl eccentric Shanku. Would request Mr. Sandip Ray to think of making sequels with some of the other Shanku Stories... better still if they are ""Prof. Rhondy's Time Machine"" or ""Prof. Shanku o U.F. O."", because then we'll get to see Nakur Chandra Biswas again... and Kudos to SVF for making it possible to bring it alive on screen.

1061,Red-125,What it means when a shirt is made in Bangladesh,9,8 September 2020,"Made in Bangladesh (2019) is a Bengali film co-written and directed by Rubaiyat Hossain.This movie is an homage to Made in Dagenham (2010). Rikita Nandini Shimu portrays Shimu Akhtar, which was the Sally Hawkins role in the English film. However badly the workers were treated in Dagenham, the workers in Bangladesh are treated worse.For example, they are forced to work into the night to complete an order, and then told they have to stay at the plant and sleep on the floor. The final blow is that management turns off the large electric fan that makes the heat bearable.The best option open to the women is to form a union, but that turns out to be extraordinarily difficult. Everyone is against them--some of their colleagues, their husbands, management of course, and, as we learn, the ministry of labor.
How the women react to this mountain of opposition is the plot of the movie.Rikita Nandini Shimu is a skilled professional actor. She inhabits the role and makes it her own. It was a pleasure to watch her act.The film is based on a real-life labor organizer, who helped in making the film. What we see is drama, not documentary, but it's based on reality.This movie worked well enough on the small screen. We watched it as a virtual screening from Rochester's great Little Theatre. It carries an respectable IMDb rating of 7.1. I thought it was much better than that, and rated it 9.",Made in Bangladesh,tt8147262
1062,euroGary,Definitely worth watching - but one-sided?,7,10 October 2019,"I used to live in Dhaka, and one of my abiding memories from that time is seeing the streams of women in their brightly-coloured saris and shalwar kameez on their way to work in the city's many garment factories. 'Made in Bangladesh' is a social drama about what happens when one such worker tries to unionise her colleagues.Shimu is a young wife whose husband is unemployed. The couple are behind on their rent so not being paid the overtime she has earned is a big blow for Shimu. The final straw comes when a fire at the factory kills one of her friends. A women's rights activist encourages Shimu to start and register a union, a development which produces one of the film's flaws: there are several info-dump lectures about worker's rights which, while perhaps necessary, do feel rather clunky. It is also unfortunate that the factory's management are all portrayed as money-grabbing, worker-hating men, making the production feel like a socialist-feminist propaganda piece.On the other hand, I like the portrayal of the camaraderie between the factory workers, and the fact that Shimu's husband, although making known his reservations about her activism, does not try to stop her - at first, that is.One final point: bearing in mind this is very much a film about women's empowerment and contains some grousing from the workers that as women they have little power, it would have been interesting to mention that, with one or two exceptions of temporary technocratic rule, Bangladesh has been ruled by *female* Prime Ministers since 1991!",Made in Bangladesh,tt8147262
1063,sildarmillion,Must-watch for everyone who buys clothes,1,31 October 2020,"""Made in Bangladesh"", the title, refers to the tag on our clothes that tell us where that piece of clothing was made. Fast fashion sells us cheap clothes because they are able to exploit the labor of poor women from third world countries, whose pay is so low that even the cheap prices of these clothes seem like their product is being marked up a lot to them.Of course this movie speaks to the experiences of the garments factory workers in Bangladesh only, but I imagine the experiences of the workers in other countries who make clothes for fast fashion can't be much different. And the movie does an excellent job of showing the nuanced complexities of the scenario.Yes, the factories are exploiting these women, but these jobs provide them with freedom for the first time in their lives. Despite this freedom, there is still so much limitations they face due to society.The plot of the movie revolves around factory workers trying to get unionized. They face many obstacles including their factory management finding out, their families objecting, and the government officials being uncooperative. But the movie tackles so many more issues such as the problem of unemployment among men and how they have a hard time relying on their wife as primary earner, how essential it is for women to get married in order to be safe, but how at the same time their husbands can hold them back, and also just the conditions this class of workers are forced to live in.I was thinking that this movie might be awkward because after all, it is about how to form a union, so perhaps it would feel like an instructional video. But it really didn't. I was surprised by how well it flowed, how well it built up the stakes, and how invested I could becomes in those stakes.I think it is very important to watch for us to know what it takes for us to get easy access to our clothes. The solution for these women is not for us to boycott fast fashion, but rather to pressure corporations to commission their clothes only from factories that are compliant and treat their workers with dignity.",Made in Bangladesh,tt8147262
1064,severajaaho,Classic storytelling in a new setting,7,16 February 2020,"The social drama takes the viewer to the factories where their clothes are made. The storytelling and cinemography reminded me of older European films from the 40's and 50's that dealt with the same issues: workers rights, women's role in a patriarchal society and a corrupt system. Though much of these ills have been improved in the privileged west, they are not gone from the world, far from it. The story is engaging and setting is interesting and colorful. Though the film feels at times it has been made for social studies class, it is nevertheless emotional and capturing story that does great work in bringing awareness on the issues that it portrays.

1065,Notebooks_on_Cinema,A hidden gem,1,7 January 2021,"I was casually browsing through Amazon Prime and nonchalantly zeroed in on this film. From the first frame to the very last, I was hooked. The subject matter is super relevant. The acting of all the characters achieve the naturalism of a documentary. No frills, no make-up, no vulgarity, not apologetic. It's cruelly honest. It addresses a plethora of topics of utmost concern: workplace exploitation, gender bias, right to life and freedom, patriarchy, women empowerment. All of it without being preachy for a moment.This is one of those films that never receives what it deserves. I hope it breaks away from that tyranny and achieves the bright star that it so deservingly need.

1066,titonsahashuvo,Better one!,8,20 May 2019,"Bangladeshi art films are improving day by day. But, it has a long way to run. At least Touquir & some other new directors are trying their best. Though the plot of the film is different in an angle but it is not strong enough as it is connected to our history, I think. I've seen lots of patriotic films. So, I can say that it fails to touch my soul heartily. Actually I wasn't bored; I expected something more. Tisha, Hayat, Babu & Siam have tried their well. I'm giving it 8 out of 10 as it's different from our regular films, different thought, good initiative, impressing scenarios & for wishing best of luck to Touquir Ahmed & to Bangladeshi art films. üôÇ

Yet another Artistic Beauty from one of our BEST!!Fagun Hawaay is the 6th Directorial of Tauqir Ahmed. All his previous 5 movies have been appreciated highly by the audience. So, audience obviously had some high expectations from Fagun Hawaay. And It Truly Lives Up To The Expectations.Set in 1952, the movie describes the situation of Bangladesh back then. The story revolves around a village named ""Chandrapur"" & it's people. It shows how Pakistan tried to impose Urdu on the Bangladeshis. A Pakistani officer who joins being in charge of the village, Forces everyone to learn Urdu & talk in Urdu. Even he can't bear a bird singing in Bangla. He wants the bird to learn Urdu & forces it to learn Urdu. However, Nasir & his team who perform Theatre Plays, can't be controlled by the Officer. They raise their voices & stands for their rights. This way the story moves forward. The film also beautifully portrays the love story of Nasir & Dipti.Many people have a concept in their mind that, Tauqir Ahmed's films are slow & not ""Commercial"". Also going by the concept, many thought this film will be more of a 'Serious' film. But its not. Tauqir Ahmed blends humour perfectly into the story. The first half is very entertaining. Specially Yashpal Sharma, Shaju Khadem give a lot of laughter moments. In the 2nd half the movie obviously needs to move but still it doesn't loose it's flow. At the same time there are moments which can make you cry. And who else than Fazlur Rahman Babu can portray emotion BEST on screen. The film is a complete package of Humour,Emotion,Drama. Well, it has everything that needs to make a film, A perfect one.Acting : The film's USP is it's Casting. Yashpal Sharma, Tisha, Babu, Siam, Abul Hayat, Shaju, Ronok, Shacchu. Tauqir Ahmed has gone for all the most talented ones anyone could have ever casted for their movie. Yashpal Sharma has done a great job. Obviously he is a very good actor. Siam Ahmed, I really believe he'll be topping the chart very soon. He performs Nasir perfectly. Tisha looked good all the way. Fazlur Rahman Babu had not much of a screen time, but he Nails It everytime he is On Screen. Everyone else did exactly the same their roles required them to do.Other Aspects : Dialogues of the film are Beautiful. Truly they are. Tauqir Ahmed has written some very motivational & lovely words. Direction by him is Great as always. Perhaps the screenplay could have been a bit tighter, but can't be complained.Cinematography was Okay. Not so great. Editing was good. Music By Pinto Ghosh & Rokon Emon was very good. The title song is very beautiful. Also the Background score by Rokon Emon must be appreciated.Well, I've enjoyed ""Fagun Hawaay"". And I will recommend it highly. This one shouldn't be missed. This is a film which will take you with it for a journey. It'll make you laugh, it'll bring tears in your eyes & also give you Goosebumps.At the end, Wanna Thank My fav Tauqir Ahmed for making another beautiful film. Would request him to keep making movies like this. Also to Siam Ahmed, Don't wanna miss watching your movies every year in the theatreRating : üåüüåüüåüüåü/5",In Spring Breeze,tt8072666

1075,naasihasiddiqui,Helps me connect with family history,8,7 April 2019,"I got to see this film on the big screen, with Bangladeshi community, which is great. My parents are survivors of the Bangladeshi Liberation War which came later. My first words were in Bangla, but as an American, at this point in my life, I have a pretty limited capacity to speak in Bangla. The film was helpful for me to connect back with my heritage and be reminded of how much of a struggle it was to just preserve the richness of Bengali culture, without having to absorb the grief, which sometimes happens and overwhelms me at cultural events.",In Spring Breeze,tt8072666
1076,cyborgsmosh,A huge leap in bangladeshi filmmaking,8,19 April 2020,"A beautiful mix of history and fiction, this movie balances those elements in a reflective manner. Though some characters are a bit exaggerated and messes up the tone, overall this is a lovely little story wrapped in the politics of the 1952 Bangla language movement. Bangladeshi films are inching closer to quality introspection, and I hope someday we can create a film to be truly proud of.

1079,msunando,Welcome to a party that will not be so,6,10 May 2020,"Basu Paribar - You are invited to attend the celebration of the 50th marriage anniversary of Pranabendu (Soumitra Chatterjee) and Manjari (Aparna Sen) Basu, at their old, ancestral, palatial abode. The family will be there - their two children (played by Rituparna and Jisshu), the former's nephews Tonu (Kaushik Sen) and Tublu (Shashwata Chatterjee), and significant other few. A feast is planned in the evening and the family is bound to reminisce upon the past fifty years of the couple, lovingly and with respect.But the palace has a few deep, dark secrets that are best buried in the past. There are certain individuals in the gathering who have an inkling of a seething rage that's shackled somewhere within the sprawling premises, releasing which may disturb the equilibrium and rattle the peaceful existence of the royal lineage. The fragile pride of the royal blood will not be strong enough to hide the uncomfortable tale of an unrequited love story that's best kept secret. Several other revelations are made during the course of the film that crack open wounds that may never heal again, though.Basu Paribar could we have been a classic akin to D. H. Lawrence's Lady Chatterley's Lover, but falls short of being bold and outspoken, perhaps in an attempt to steer clear of controversy and to allow the royal pride to remain intact. There are a few mature performances, Aparna Sen's being outstanding, followed by that of Shashwata and Soumitra Chatterjee. It's an ensemble cast, but Sreenanda Shankar still makes her presence felt on her debut among the stalwarts.",The Bose Family,tt7994100

At first it seems like a story centered around family, of the happenings of a single parent dad trying to raise his only daughter along with his own mother. The movie takes a very ham-handed approach when it comes to showing how ""close"" the parent and child are. By showing scenes of them together not once, not twice but thrice! And none of the scenes are subtle, they are very clearly laid out to get the point across that the daughter and father in question have a close relationship. Establishing the fact that they have a close relationship is fine but the way its presented is ridiculous. The first scene alone established their relationship, there was no need to have so many scenes with the same message. It only lengthened the time and reduced the quality of the movie.Secondly, the romance sub plot seemed completely unnecessary. A vast majority of the time spent on it was centered around the daughter of the protagonist so when it seemed like the main male and female leads weren't going to end up together. It wasn't shocking or sad, it actually made sense cause they hardly had any spark or connection to begin with. In fact the only real connection visible was between the female lead and the daughter character, that was the only relationship capable of garnering any sympathy. But even that gets thrown under the bus when the female lead literally gets over the male lead in like a day and goes after another guy. Moving on is one thing but it was comical how fast the female lead got over the male lead. Yes, it wasn't permanent and she still had feelings for the male lead but it was just hilarious how quickly she switched from one marriage proposal to the next.Lastly, the friendship plot line in the last half of the movie. I honestly don't know what to make of it but its nothing positive. The character presented seemed rushed, added so that there is drama and certain plot holes could be filled. Both the male lead and his friend were very over dramatic. The friend character is friendly initially but then turns hostile after awhile. Then he seems to go through a redemption arc which makes it all better somehow? The last bit of the movie is also littered with flashbacks.All in all, this movie is a muddled mess of story lines with characters that are either one dimensional or hardly developed. A beginning that takes too long to get going and a story that isn't worth watching. Not recommended at all.",The Sacrifice,tt7817568

1095,ankuripe,How to turn a good into bad,5,26 March 2019,"Movie üé• has started very calmly not even has any kickoff , may be a family movie purely but that's ok. But stretching same scenes ( very little changes and common trend in every scenes) made it boring. And second half started with little twisting just to made it 2 hrs movie. If you see the movie the content was good and making was very articulated but disproportionately distribution of scenes , Putting lot of emotion in the beginning with a slow motion but end the movie in fast fashion and hurrying to perplexed it.If you consider it with a FISH as a metaphor - the head is very little , the body become more thinner than head but the Tail become too much wider and heavy. And imagine how that type of fish will swim normally.Keep making new movie. üëç

1100,rabib_coool,Worst Bangladeshi movie in the recent years.,1,9 March 2019,"To be hundred percent honest there are worse Bangladeshi movies than this, but those movies are not starring Tahsan. As one of the pioneers of new age ""tv natok"" Tahsan should have delivered a better performance. He has a huge fan-following, who deserves better than this.
Direction was just bad. I don't how Mostafa Kamal became a movie director. There were laziness in every camera shot. First one hour of the movie was going nowhere. Overall there was no story to tell. His best achievements in this movie is being able to cast Tahsan, nothing else.
Lastly this kind of lacklustre effort is not doing any good to the Bangladeshi cinema.

1109,Thechocolateboy,A STUNNER,9,30 May 2020,"For those who do not know about the director, he is the one who has the rare record of achieving national award (for Bakita Byaktigoto) among the herd of so called 'film directors' nowadays. He always stands apart from other directors in storytelling.The title card of apparently lengthy movie (2:26:40) mentions that it's based on Srikanta (Part1). But if you try to compare both, it's futile. The director takes only the characters and some of the events as well as few rural sketches to build his story, from the veteran author. The story is set on modern time, but takes its journey to down memory lane throughout the screenplay. So, two timelines flow simultaneously until he fully builds all the characters.A movie can have various techniques of storytelling, theoretically. Pradipta uses the methods of alternative reality, alternative timelines beautifully. Especially when he delivers the final blow, the climax. Spectators will expect another dull movie, and boom- the blow, the climax comes.Commercially cinema-fed eyes will feel the first half tad dragged, boring. But as soon as the second half folds itself, it catches the pace.Acting wise everyone seemed realistic; especially Ritwick. The songs are very aptly placed. Dialouges are few but crisp. Only the BGM is too loud sometimes.NB: Those who are still wondering about what really happened at the end, which one is the reality and which one is reality, or is it open ended ; here is my view : actually all four of them met their inevitable destiny, death. The middle and last scenes of happiness were only the dream vision of both Srikanta and Rajlokkhi, coz they really longed for love throughout their lives.",Rajlokhi O Srikanto,tt6999026

Be it his short films or ""bakita byaktigoto"" the man always steal your attention even after you are done seeing the movie. This is not an exception. The portrayal of rural Bengal and the sharp contrast it has with the urban one goes with the theme of the movie. Srikanto is a famous character of Bengali literature. So making a movie on that character was always risky. But the director couldn't have done a better job.

No question about Ritwick's Acting. But Jyotika Jyoti is no way near to Rajlokkhi, She doesn't posses the voice even gesture for Rajlokkhi. The word choice in the dialogue is so mundane. Some accents are from Bangladesh. Some from Indians. Didn't find any similarity with the novel except the platform.Indranath & Shrikanta's part was not so touching at first half to express the depth in their relationship at last.Simply Awkward. Donnow why Rittick choose this ?? Is this some kind of friend's help to make another friend some business in the industry.Apart from all, Timir Biswas touched the soul of mine with the song "" Amar Bhul hoye geche priyo "" Hats off , Timir Da.",Rajlokhi O Srikanto,tt6999026

The film runs at a slow pace and gives the audience sometime to appreciate the taste it offers. A number of typical folk-like songs are used which adds a nice charm to the corresponding scenes; these are also accompanied by newly made modern and semi-modern songs, which are treat to ears. The camera captures the interplay of light and shadow, rural and urban visuals beautifully.After 'bakita byaktigoto', this was again one of the unique signatures of Pradipta. Looking forward to many more gems from him.

Knowing a bit about my director friend,and also being a freelance screenplay writer myself....I really feel proud of him for writing as well as directing such a wonderful Bengali movie.
The entire storyline has been extremely well scripted and the cast chosen has been a really amazing one.
Just that in between it becomes a little slow,to add a bit of relief to the audience.But the overall tempo of the movie is very decent.And nobody was knowing exactly how will things go in between and towards the end,which actually keeps the suspense high.All in all a great work...might possibly bring about a lot of change in the Tollywood industry as well.Will surely be looking foward to more of his upcoming films.

Each and every scene is created with deft making and layers of allegory and social relevance. The film not only provides thrills but also food for thought for today's audience as to how they react to the things that are shown on Screens. Mindblowing film with top notch visuals and performance. The so called top directors of Bengali should see and level up. I couldn't believe that I am watching an independent film of such a great quality. Some minor reviews like Firstpost have given this film a cold shoulder thats why my expectation was less but later I realized that those reviews are themselves trash and biased. Happy to see there are people capable of making regional (read Bengali) films of this standard.

Fahim is a film inspired by a true story, a story that highlights our humanity, but also the big problems of our society. The characters of the film are very touching, Assad Ahmed who is rather bluffing in the role of the little Fahim but also his father played by Mizanur Rahaman who delivers a delivery of a great sensitivity. Isabelle Nanty is always so friendly and I do not think I need to explain why Gerard Depardieu is a monstrous actor. Fahim is not a great risk-taking and even chess games are filmed with simplicity, but we let ourselves be carried away by this story which takes its main strength in its relation to the real facts. And it's a good thing.

1142,loveyourlife,A decent film littered with detracting anomalies,6,17 July 2014,"Shongram was a film I was really looking forward to seeing. Billed as a British-made Bengali film about the 1971 Bangladesh independence war and featuring an international cast including highly respected Indian actor Anupam Kher in a lead role. The script is fairly decent but could have benefited from tighter edits in a couple of scenes, particularly the final newspaper office and parting scenes in India. The standout performances come from an excellent Amaan Reza as (young) freedom fighter Karim and Shubrodho who turns in a powerful performance as his Hindu friend. Dilruba Yasmeen Ruhee as his love interest is good but at times is too heavily made up-- did young girls really walk around villages in full fashion make-up in 1971? A minor point but very noticeable in a number of scenes. But this is the first of a number of quibbles I have with this film that really detract from the core narrative. The Pakistani army General Iftikhar is played like a caricature and this ruins the scenes he is in; his cruelty at times comes across as comic and even Gabbar Singh-like and which is not at all suited to this kind of film. Whether that was intentional or not is unclear but it doesn't work. I've seen a number of Bangladeshi films on 1971, including Shyamol Chhaya and Guerilla; both of which did a much better job of depicting the harshness of the struggle freedom fighters went through in my opinion. There are other minor irritations: the car with the fleeing villagers that is at least one decade too new a model to have been around at the time and the cigar-smoking editor in London; where smoking in the workplace is illegal. The casting of Asia Argento is also odd; she is supposed to be an English journalist (if you read the promotional material associated with the film) yet doesn't sound English or even British whatsoever. Again another minor criticism but one of many anomalies in this film. Anupam Kher, as (older) Karim, is as always very good but it makes you wonder how a young nicely tanned young man grew up into such a light-skinned older one? Something you just wouldn't see in a Western film; the attraction of having a star actor in the role obviously far outweighed this technicality.Nevertheless, the film tells an important story through the central character; most of the actors play their parts with emotion and conviction but the various quibbles above make this a lesser film than it should have been. Judging on this finished product, director and writer Mansur Ali shows real promise for the future, where no doubt such kinks will be ironed out over time with bigger budgets and more experience.",Shongram,tt3009068
1143,momtazbh,"A powerful, poignant tale about the liberation of Bangladesh by first-time Director Munsur Ali",9,22 July 2014,"There was a point that struck me half way through watching Shongram when I wondered why hasn't this film been made before? The Bangladesh liberation war has affected every single Bangladeshi in the world and continues to impact on people today, yet it's a part of history that outside of Bangladesh is largely unacknowledged.Debut Film Director Munsur Ali created Shongram as an opportunity to share some of the truths of what happened during the nine-month period proceeding Bangladesh's independence in 1971, which was filled with horrific atrocities that saw millions of people killed, tortured and raped.I could recount the plot, mention the cameos by established actors, hail it as New Wave British Asian cinema or critique it against other war films, but none of that is as relevant as the fact that this was an ambitious project that is also in every sense of the word a fantastic film, so that's what I'm going to concentrate on.Shongram combines fact with fiction, engaging the viewer through a plot that is captivating and well-paced. What could have turned into blood- bath with violence overtaking the plot (something I was worried about), is in fact a film that presents us with possibilities. Filmed entirely in Bangladesh, with the exception of some scenes shot in the UK to give the story its present day context, Shongram demonstrates the wealth of talent and expertise that exists in contemporary Bangladesh. Munsur has cast Bangladeshi talent in the roles and his crew required the support of locals throughout the filming process. On that merit alone it's hard to fault the film.Despite the struggles for Bangladesh's independence being largely an untold story, the viewer remains connected to Shongram through Munsur's clever inclusion of all the ingredients that make a memorable movie. There's a good dose of romance, drama, action and melodrama which makes the subject matter more accessible.The sweetness and innocence of the love story between Hindu girl Asha and Muslim boy Karim juxtaposed against the brutal rape, torture and shootings reminds us that despite the vastness of the situation, there were real individuals living through this period. Shongram is their insight; not a generalised commentary about everything that happened during the war of Bangladesh.As well as Asha's flawless village girl styling and the gorgeous landscapes, my favourite aspect of Shongram was watching Karim's character grow. An unlikely hero, at the start of the film he's a happy- go-lucky lad without a care in the world. Boyish, lovable and immature, we see how he deals with the simplicity of his village life turn into a fight for justice. As he develops into a Freedom Fighter he is forced to grow up, become an independent thinker and put his life on the line for his fellow countrymen. Little details like his expressions, the way he addresses people and his passions are captured naturally which gives his characterisation depth and a level of authenticity.Shongram has a timeless lifespan. Worthy in its content and quality of filmmaking, it fulfills more than just a personal quest of Munsur's to make a film about Bangladesh. It sheds light on an era that will provoke a reaction in all who see it. Whether it inspires the viewer to talk openly about their own experiences of independence or gets them to put their hand up and admit they knew nothing about this part of South Asian history, it is a film with positivity and potential that deserves a place in British, Bangladeshi and Bengali film history.",Shongram,tt3009068
1144,imransaany,Fantastic film about the untold genocide,1,3 May 2019,"Pleasantly surprised by the storytelling and production of Shongram and a very emotional film that I enjoyed watching. More people need to watch this and hear about the sufferings of the Bangladeshi people.

Furthermore, it explores the reasons of the odds in the rural area. The chemistry was quite a little off with Sporshia due to the acting skills that limited her to speak within their dialects that mixed with the Dhakaiya ones, until the ending.

Otherwise, the story is brilliant and the other actors foreshadowed it so well that, we can understand the flawed human beings. On the contrary, few explanations are needed! Everyone's acting is awesome but Sporshia's due to the glamorous avatar that overshadowed her acting. To further mention, the protagonist's performance and charisma could have been developed a little more to take a time to the character, otherwise a good performance. The screenplay could have been a little tighter as a romantic story but the screenwriter has the potential to capture the emotions to carry out. It has a brilliant cinematography, good to great acting performances but a story which could have developed with the characters visually, not only in a dialogue form. The ending is quite unpredictable and emotional. Overall, it has the Bengaliana feeling and a bit of a charm, with the mixture of mystery and thriller, as well as its realism!

in the other words the story was slow dramatic romance. I was getting to like the slow story, characters and plot development. Until an hour.SPOILER WARNINGüî•
(Spoiler in the bracket, just ignore if you haven't watched yet. Read below bracket to find out my 4* reason!)
(((((The story completely changed when the main actress said "" jilapi dia ki mon bhore!"". Then the happy family turned into in horrible situation, i like the works until actor went for job!)))))Then all changed! Movie got boring. Just becouse it hasn't shown perfectly. Director made it fast. Story became fast.
There were few big big twist in last 30 minutes. twists weren't consistency just becouse director couldn't highlighted very well. There were no seriousness background music, even on the protagonists!
In the last of all, everything were perfect making in first hour. I couldn't even find a single relete between name and story! üòë",Kathbirali,tt11613548

Yes, the septuagenarian is suffering from the Alzheimer's disease that has plunged his life into a quandary and his wife Shubha (Gargi Roy Chowdhury) is doing her best to be with him in trying to restore his memory. She knows it is incurable, but will not back down from the difficult situation. Dr. Nilabho Roy (Parambrata Chattopadhyay) is his neurologist, standing at the juncture of life where he has broken away from his mediocre past, is a celebrity practitioner with a bright future. But his personal life is in a disarray as his wife has decided to leave him with their little daughter, his parents want him to stay with them in their middle class, dilapidated home and he finds himself hopelessly lonely.But there is hope in life. Nilabho will find a solution to finding happiness for Amitava and his wife, and in the process realize that all the recognition, reputation and wealth are of no consequence if he doesn't have the blessings of his parents and the companionship of his wife and daughter.Sraboner Dhara is a heartwarming disquisition about psychological conditions, one of a helpless patient and the other trying to battle his own demons from the past. Helmed by Sudeshna Roy and Abhijit Guha, the 108 minutes pass quite quickly as the film is content driven and has brilliant performances by Soumitra Chatterjee, Gargi Roy Chowdhury and Basabdatta Chatterjee. But Parambrata pulls out a stunner here, he is subdued, mellow, confident and expressive.",Sraboner Dhara,tt11497808

This movie shows us how important is family life and without it we are nothing.. The relation between husband and wife is so important and Basabdatta Chatterjee &Parambrata Chattopadhyay naturally play their roles. In a word fantastic. Oops sorry to mention Soumitra Chatterjee and Gargi Roy Chowdhury. The actors lived their roles. What a nice way to portray some of the realities of life. Crisp direction and sequencing of events. The tough job of the directors made to look easy. A lot of hard work has gone into filming it. A wonderful movie that gave the reflection of Psychological Clashes amid unavoidable responsibilities, commitments, and dedication. Touched my heart. A film with deep emotions.

"" Zombiesthan "" is damn underrated . In Bengali film industry , there is always a budget issue and so action sequences or the vfx parts were bad . But the writing of the film was awesome . Very interesting and engaging screenplay !Rajatavo Dutta's career best performance ! Tanushree Chakraborty and Rudranil Ghosh performed well . The editing was very sharp .

1179,msunando,This Sunday is as lazy and limp as the script,4,19 April 2020,"Robibaar (On A Sunday, on Hoichoi) - Sayani (Jaya Ahsan) is a legal affairs manager of an MNC and is simultaneously working on publishing her own book. On a lazy Sunday morning, she heads to a coffee shop for breakfast where she has a chance meeting with Asimabha (Prasenjit Chatterjee), her beau from 15 years ago. Or is it?What follows is a dribble between their past life and experiences and their present, through which we learn that Asimabha is a brilliant individual with devious motives. He has led a life of con, has none to go back to, law is hotly chasing him and he has paid money to a hitman to murder him as suicide isn't something that he has the courage to do. But somewhere in his heart he is repentant and thinks that he can redeem himself by rescuing a street urchin. Now Asimabha and Sayani can use each other for mutual benefit, perhaps.If the writer-director Atanu Ghosh thought that this is content enough and will engage the viewers, he got it all wrong. The story, if you can call it that, refuses to take off. It whines and grates, unable to lift it's own weight and crawls forward like a sloth, testing our patience. You keep waiting expectantly for something dramatic to happen or a twist in the story, but alas there isn't any. With just two characters around it also becomes quite monotonous to listen to their inane humming. Actually, not much emotive skills are on display here as there isn't much demand for it. Of course there isn't much chemistry between them too as they separated 15 years ago - really?",Robibaar,tt11349676

This film may move towards success (if so) only due to balanced Acting by the two Jaya Ahsan, Prosenjit Chatterjee and Debjyoti Mishra(Music) .

1182,dipsenindia,"Robibaar - Dark, mysterious ...",8,9 February 2020,"They met after fifteen years and for a moment, the audience is swept by a strong whiff of the passion that has survived over the years. The Man dressed in black kurta is suave and presumptuous. The Lady is a trifle unsure but feels drawn to the familiar air of unsolved mystery that is quintessentially him. Her glance is a mixture of loathing, disgust and withered love.
She feels bound to stay back when he is desperate and earnest. Added to this is the intoxicating thought of wringing from him a kind of confession, not a desperate attempt to make him suffer but more of a selfish idea of using his story to be used as an ingredient in a research book penned by her.
The narrative is not a linear progression of events but more of a magnification of feelings,of what happens on a Sunday. An intense study of a relationship gone dry and dead, yet quickened to life by the random stirring caused by a chance meeting and interaction.Sunday is a day to relax and unwind but it is also a day when official work is usually kept on hold. What happens when more and more days of life resemble a Sunday? What happens when it is hard to remember the extraordinary significance of a Sunday?
In the end, it is like a long, winding conversation between two people.The course of future rests on their hands.
The past has left its irrevocable stamp.
You can smell yesterday.
But it cannot be stitched back seamlessly.
The crack remains to taunt.
Tears of regret or a deal to be made, it is essentially their choice.",Robibaar,tt11349676

Seriously, I don't understand! Also, there was too much of a pause while delivering dialogues, i mean what the heck? The Zee bangla serials are much better! The ending was too idiotic! I would suggest not to not waste your precious time and money on this at all!

1186,suchitraray,unconventional narrative & it is quite a remarkable watch,9,10 February 2020,"The beauty of this film is the unconventional narrative and the changing perspective of its setting. Usually, a traditional reunion would take place over social occasion, business meets, or even an accident. This reunion becomes engaging all the more because it moves from one scenario to another, each locale interesting for its characteristics. The trickster has run out of tricks and luck, with no hope for tomorrow.
Given its wafer thin story line, the faith of this film purely hinged on the nature of the conversations, and the performance of its cast. It's here that the director is blessed to have Prosenjit Chatterjee and Jaya Ahsan who are almost flawless in the portrayal of their layered characters. While both Asimabha and Sayani evoke a sense of frustration, but you don't want to be judgmental about them. Morality would abhor them, particularly Asimabha, but their imperfections also brings them acceptability.
Chatterjee is exemplary in his portrayal of the sullen, despondent man. The litany of cases has clearly dragged the once self-styled magical trickster down. He's sinned a lot, but there still is an honest streak in him. That is seen from his kind gesture in adopting a street urchin. It's quite an evocative film, with abundance of subtext allowing the viewer to build his or her interpretations and it is this aspect which makes it rather niche. It's certainly not for those who want films to be ready to digest material. Infact, they might find this film to be quite a nuisance. But of you spend on concentration and sensitivity, it is quite a remarkable watch.",Robibaar,tt11349676
1187,samantaksen,Engaging if you choose to be patient,9,11 February 2020,"When oversimplification has become the trend, the director here chooses not to spell it all out. Neither does he indulge in any kind of sentimentality at the meeting of the lovers fifteen years later; rather, he leaves the narrative open, and time and again breaks it to provide a new insight into the relationship.The tangent the film takes with these digressions threw me off till I realized the grander design of the director. Liked the deviation from routine. Quite a novel format for a Bangla film I presume. Wonder if it would find much takers among the soap addicted audience. But if someone tends to have some patience, he would be richly rewarded.

1188,msunando,Ideologies at war,6,18 January 2020,"Ghawre Baire Aaj - is the modern and contemporary adaptation of Rabindranath Tagore's original ""Ghare Baire"" helmed by Aparna Sen. It is intended to highlight a clash of ideologies of the liberals who believe in the secular India and the hardline right wing Hindus, a subject of much deliberation these days, and hence quite pertinent. Nikhilesh (Anirban Bhattacharya) is the face of the traditional believer of the original identity of the secular nation, preaching and practicing liberalism whilst dedicating himself to social causes. In contrast, Sandeep Jha (Jishu Sengupta) is the hardliner aspiring to be a Rajya Sabha member ready to pull down all full stops to achieve his goals, ruthless, scheming and agenda driven. Between the two childhood friends who coexist in a repressed and untold friction is Brinda (Tuhina Das), the young wife of the former, who unfortunately turns out to be a chessboard pawn in the game of oneupmanship, being used to establish supremacy without her knowledge. The consequences are diabolical and the fire will consume everyone, seemingly a metaphorical representation of what the director believes will be the outcome of the current chasm. Quite possible!The trio produce a scintillating performance and Anirban in particular must be complimented for an exceptional rendition of Nikhilesh. It's a well nuanced essay that firmly establishes him in the league of the industry's top tier. The adaptation of the novel however, fails to upraise the battle of ideologies to a flashpoint, avoiding direct confrontation. It is kept at a symbolic and indirect exchange of views and that, in my opinion is an opportunity lost to cascade the message. Brinda's character has been designed as brittle too, who at the first available opportunity jumps into infidelity without any remorse and the director provides a meek justification for her actions. Upon being spurned, she immediately terms her dalliance an infatuation, which seemed like an unlikely end to the strong extramarital relationship and being a transformed protege to Sandeep. The film also shows hardliners more as power hungry conspirators than believers of the right wing ideology, which needn't be the case though - after all hardliners exist because they may believe in their cause too.",Ghawre Bairey Aaj,tt11200922

My hopes were set high by the choice of the relevant political issues and, of course, the fact that this is an adaptation of the fascinating Tagore novel. Why did you need to ruin the novel by doing this? The film throws away its potentials through undeveloped, unnecessary subplots. And the actress is just not up to the mark. A film on such a burning issue ought to have been much more responsible. Et tu, Aparna!

1191,ranikaith,Not as good as rays version,5,17 March 2020,"To be honest i expected more from this movie especially after watching satijat rays Version. Its difficult to describe it, but his version felt more ,, complete''.
This movie was somehow unrealistic, like which upper caste male (brahman in this case)decides to marry a former servant from the dalit caste? apart from that its highely critical that a tribal girl is shown as,,tamed'' and brahmanized and pictured as a good will project of nikhels mother and its morally questionable from nikhils side to marry a Dalit to highlight his liberal worldview. i mean come on.
Maybe thats the reason i couldnt connect to the characters at all, the whole movie felt like out of reality and addressed in my eyes a certain ,, intellectual'' group ( which might not be bad, but the movies topic is more than relevant today in indians society, and should be presented to a wider audience)and aparna sen was able to reach a wider publicum with mr&mrs iyer, which also dealed with a similar topic.
Another point i want to adress is the flat character development of sandip, he is shown as the bad guy driven only by greed for power and immorality. In rays version he appeared far more nuanced ,this also applies to nikhils character. And lastly the death of the muslim boy, which leads to a change in the thinking of his hindu nationalistic friend and adjoining vigils, feels rushed and out of place. It appears like a cheap solution to finish quickly the movie.Apart from this weaknesses it was a decent movie, addressing an important issue.",Ghawre Bairey Aaj,tt11200922

I was impressed with th three main actors--only conscious of having seen one other Aparna Sen film she dealt with the emotions very well. Also thought the cinematography was subtle and as with the background music helped set mood. Very good.

They have links with Naxals and they distort history. Whereas people who believe in Communism are innocent, Naxalism has nothing to do with Communists, they help poor and tribal people.

1195,anuraggoswami-22227,Impeccable adaptation and modernization of the Tagore Classic,9,26 December 2019,"''And they lived Happily ever after.....''
Well this didn't apply to the life of Sandeep, Bimla (a.k.a Brinda) and Nikhilesh Choudhary. Directed by Padma Shri and National Award winner, Aparna Sen - Ghawre Baire Aaj is truly a cinematic experience to its utmost supremacy. A modern retelling of the Tagore's novel, ""Ghawre Bairey"" it is a story of Love, Friendship, Illusion, Truth and above all ""Clashing Idologies""
Story :
The Tagore's Ghawre Bairey deals with a complex love triangle of Nikhilesh, his wife Bimla and his friend Sandip. Bimla - who has never known any other man except her husband, realises that there is a perplexing emotions of her relations with Sandip. The film explores the emotional upheaval attached to this Love triangle. It is a socio-political drama which hit the thetre yesterday and a film which you should definitely go and watch.
Now, I was going to give a review when I saw that the film has a got a lot of negative reviews all over the internet. So, I have decided that I will tell you some reasons which I have liked and disliked in the movie and then I will leave it to you.
REASONS TO WATCH THE MOVIE :
1. Brinda's Story- The film has given Brinda a new dimension. The film tells her past. The film starts with Brinda addressing the audience, a snippet of childhood as how she happened to be this little skinny girl who happened to run around in the fields of Jharia till one day her parents died and she was taken to her Amma's (grand ma's) place in Delhi where she used to work as a Nanny in Nikhilesh's place. There she was brought up as their own daughter and then again we are brought to today's time when she tells us that she works as proof reader at the Oxford press and married to Nikhilesh. Although they have a huge age gap, they still share a very healthy relationship and Brinda respects a Nikhilesh a lot for the person he is.
2. Clashing Ideologies leading to change of Equation-
Nikhilesh and Sandeep were childhood friends. They went to the same school and college. 20 years after their college, we see Nikhilesh is an editor of a digital newspaper called India Online and his friend Sandeep is an aspiring right-wing politician who wants to establish India as a Hindu Nation. Sandeep, who was a leftist in his collge days today turned into a right wing nationalist due to a chain of events that happened in the film and that has been shown by the director with brilliance.
3. The modernised adaptation- What was shown by Tagore and Ray was a pre-independence problem, "" Swadeshi Movement"" Although we have all read in our History books that Swadeshi Movement eventually lead to the Brits leaving India but we don't know what were the sufferings of the poor shopkeepers had been during those days. We get to see that from Nikhlesh's eyes in Ghawre Baire . Although Ghawre baire Aaj tells a completely different story. It tells us about the Hindu Muslim conflicts, the poverty of the Bastar region and a conflict of opinions regarding a dispute piece of land in Bastar. While Nikhilesh and his people wanted to make a Hospital out there for the poor and under privileged of that area, Sandeep and his party wanted to make a Temple. The conflict is also between a man who acts because the action is profitable (Sandip) and one who acts only when it is good (NIkhilesh)
4. Nostalgia- Anirban Bhattacharya, @JisshuSengupta and @TuhinaDas in the lead and @AnjanDutt and Rwitobroto Mukherjee in key roles this film surely triggers nostalgia.
WHAT I DISLIKED ABOUT THE FILM WAS :
The film finds itself burdened by the heavy conflict between its political ideology and the human drama. The scene of Brinda's observation of Sandip, wondering ""if only Nikhilesh spoke as passionately"", becomes an allegory on the current world seduced by leaders that are brash in speech and direct in action, often to distressing effect. Yet, on the screen, the scenes play on with staid effect. I personally think, Aparna Sen would have done better to focus on the human drama and let the politics evolve through it.Talking about the acting. Every one has portrayed their character in the bestest way possible. Kudos to Tuhina Das for her work is something I have truly become a fan of. Nevertheless, all the other actors did equally well. Not worthy of these much of negative reviews. Must Watch if you are a Movie Lover.",Ghawre Bairey Aaj,tt11200922

1197,priyankasany,Interesting take on Tagore's story,6,25 April 2020,"This is an interpretation of Tagore's story set in the India of 2019 where buoyed by political forces, a large part of the population has experienced a renewed recognition of their religious identity. If you have seen the original Ray classic, this film is bound to get you at least interested. Some of the incidents shown don't come across as strong plot-builders and more as half-hearted attempts to build the central characters. Art direction is wonderful, and is able to transport you into the fabled life of Delhi's intelligentsia. Tuhina's performance never slips, and Anirban is pretty solid. It is the more seasoned Jisshu Sengupta who is unconvincing at times, especially because lots of viewers have Soumitra's performance in the Ray film in mind, and this character is not one-track at all. While your mind does wander to Ray's classic several times during the film, the end does hit you and wraps up the film pretty well. There is inspiration from Painted Veil and the Gauri Lankesh incident (Sen dedicates the film to the social activist). Definitely not Sen's best directorial effort.

1199,palasreesaha,Wide-ranging movie,1,15 November 2019,"Ghawre Baire Aaj is an excellent dramatic creation of Aparna Sen..... it is one of the best scribble of Aparna Sen....each and every character and the persons ( Nikhilesh Chowdhury, Brinda Chowdhury and Sandip Jha and else.. meaningly Anirban Bhattachrya, Tuhina Das and Jisshu U Sengupta and more..) in this movie kept their rummy dispotion evidences. The base of the story fiercely shows the political and intestine familiar story of almost evry relationships and the bondings..After all this movie will give an unprecedented perception to each person.... :)

1200,somab-98562,The liberal discourse has to change,3,12 January 2020,"This movie is a representation of Tagore's story, rewritten in today's perspective. The symbolic narrative of Dalit siding with liberal ideology is a pass√©. And should be abandoned. The liberal saviour played by Anirban Bhattacharya stresses on the 'Ps', 'Ts' and 'Ks' May sound enduring to the ear, but that was not needed to subjugate the broken Bangla spoken by Tuhina Das. The only justified role and performance was of Jishu Sengupta who was supposed to be the exploiting Hindutva Brigade soldier.
The movie is not a great work of Aparna Sen either.

1201,bgomesta,Tagore is a great philosopher and Aparna Sen modernized this adeptly,1,5 April 2020,"The movie started with an excellent setting where a progressive and kind-hearted family adopted an orphan girl and the adopted mother treated her like their own girl. As usual Aparna Sen skillfully directed every scene where love, friendship, politics, ideologies, and conflicts and tensions among these various aspects of life and society climaxed up and down perfectly to offer a heart-touching and satisfying experience. The movie is both entertaining and spiritually satisfying.

1212,nafiukabir,A Potential Story Wasted By A Very Poor Second Half,5,28 September 2019,"Despite having a potential story of doing wonders, Shapludu fails to deliver. Couldn't do justice to it's gripping story. The film could have been an absolute winner, but it is far from that !!To be very honest the plot of Shapludu was as good as anyone could've asked. It had the twists to make it a perfect thriller. But inappropriate presentation & a very ordinary 2nd half makes the film look poor.The film starts to make you guess from the very beginning. Gives you enough feel of a thriller. But yet the way the characters were introduced & presented, could've been much better. The film picks up it's pace after the first half an hour or so. That's the best part of the film. As the film progresses towards interval, it presents one after another thrilling twists which makes it look like an edge-of-the-seat thriller. Expectations were high after a very good first half.But sadly it could never create the same environment again in the 2nd half of the film. The 2nd half of the film is slow, boring & very badly organised. The story needed much stronger portrayal than what we see in the film. Its not the actors who fails to perform, rather it's the screenplay which makes the film look incomplete at every point. All of it looked rusty. As an audience you'll always find yourself searching for something in the film which is actually missing & thus makes it unpleasant. Again the climax of the film could've saved it from completely drowning but it's much more disappointing. Overall you come out of the theatre being disappointed seeing a very well crafted movie plot being wasted like this.Acting :- Arifin Shuvo, the lead cast of the film looks good, but only in bits & pieces of the film. His comic timing always looked forced. And in the 2nd half the character needed much more seriousness to it, which Shuvo fails to give. On the other hand, Bidya Sinha Mim plays her role pretty well. But its really the other Three members of the lead cast, who really stood out. Zahid Hasan, Tarik Anam Khan & Salauddin Luvlu.Though Zahid Hasan's character wasn't given much screen time in the first half, but whenever he had to deliver, he did it perfectly. And eventually he justifies his potential as an actor in the very last scene. Salauddin Luvlu's comic timing was very good. Plays his character to perfection. Tarik Anam Khan too does a great job. The film has quite a few cameos by some of the very good actors, which were good in terms of acting but again looked meaningless.Other Aspects :-Director Golam Sohrab Dodul gives you reasons to feel that he has the potential to deliver, but he certainly missed the opportunity to completely justify that in Shapludu. A messed up 2nd half suggests, he wasn't in control of what he was trying to say through his film.If you have to pick one best thing about the film, it would be the cinematography. It was beautiful. But like many other movies of ours, the colour of the film makes it look unpleasant to eyes. Music of the film was good. Both background score & songs were praise worthy.Overall I'd say as an audience I went to the theatre with some good expectations, which turned into high hopes after the first half. But the second half turned out to be as bad as I was hoping it not to be.Nafiu Kabir",Shapludu (Bengali),tt10984586

1214,srabonurz,It's a kinda cheat of calling it a thriller movie,4,2 October 2019,"Honestly, u can't make a thriller film with silly suspenses.But the director did it. This story was nothing but a joke. I wanna ask director - why did u call it a political thriller without adding any kinds of sensible suspense.. Watching Saapludu was a total waste of time.. But i would like to praise the casting... It was very praisable. To make a good film You'll have to focus on script. You can't run a 2 hours film only with good actin, when there was no story.

1228,sharmisthanag,Good movie,8,12 October 2020,"The movie is undoubtedly very well presented. Needless to mention the excellent performances of Soumitra Chatterjee and Lily Chakraborty. Paoli Dam and Dev have played their parts very well. However, this age old concept of children settled in foreign countries fail to take care of their parents, turn out to be selfish, and don't feel for their old parents, need to change. It really boils down to the human being, regardless of where they are settled.

One of the best Bengali films of the year. Very matured acting by all the casts. The film addresses a problem faced by all the elderly people suffering from isolation and the execution has been fantastic. You remain glued to the edge of your seat throughout the movie. Hats off to team Sanjhbatiüëåüëåüëå

1237,arunangshupal-65148,Worst Byomkesh film; Wrong casting of lead characters,1,22 July 2020,"This film is clearly the worst of all Byomkesh Bakshi films. Parambrata Chatterjee is not good enough and does not look like Byomkesh Bakshi. He does not have the required screen presence. The actor cast as Ajit is horrible, and this makes one wonder how in the world the director Sayantan Ghosal (or whoever might be the casting director) thought of casting a poor actor like Rudranil Ghosh as the iconic character of Ajit. Ghosh does not also have the looks to play Ajit, a character who is a writer and a gentleman with grace and kindness. The film does not hold the attention of the viewer in any way. Finally, calling the nationalist and philosopher Sri Aurobindo a ""terrorist"" does not help. The producers, the director and the screenwriter (and the actress who said the line) are lucky that no one sued them in court for defamation, blasphemy and gross historical inaccuracy.

The film Satyennashi Byomkesh has been exceptionally made and the actors' performance, art design, cinematography are great and direction given by Sayantan Ghoshal is awesome.
A must watch film for everyone.
